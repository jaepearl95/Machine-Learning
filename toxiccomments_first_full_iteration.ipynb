      "Some parting comments re: the two images; for those still seeking to document the licenses that reference \"\"public domain\"\" in Poland and/or in the United States, one might want to take a look at the \"\"Photo credits\"\" in the PBS (U.S. public television) documentary Website for its series Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State (2005); about a week ago I edited the article on the BBC program to include the source citations for the PBS broadcast of the same program (with diff. title).\n",
      "(cont.) Today, while searching \"\"images of Auschwitz prisoners public domain\"\" out of residual curiosity re: this matter, I located one photo credit referring to \"\"public domain\"\" in the U.S.-published Website for the BBC program shown on PBS: it is a photo credit for \"\"Auschwitz prisoners\"\" (not Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum/Wilhelm Brasse photographs, but photographs taken contemporaneously at Auschwitz in period from 1940 to 1945, depicting prisoners outside on the grounds of the camp at a barbed wire fence, e.g.: see Credits, scroll down to \"\"Auschwitz prisoners\"\", and go to page 1 (hyperlinked) to see the photographs.  If PBS is citing \"\"public domain\"\" in the United States, this might be a helpful precedent to cite re: Auschwitz photographs (taken by Polish photographers w/o copyright credits being given?).  Just a thought.\n",
      "(cont.) I do not expect to be editing Wikipedia much if at all in the near future, so I thought I'd leave others with this possible publication precedent in the U.S. for citing U.S. (and possiblly worldwide) \"\"public domain\"\" re: photographs of Auschwitz prisoners; though I am not sure it applies in the UK or European Union too; that would not matter if it applies in the U.S.\n",
      "(cont.) The so-called duplicate photograph (3 poses) of Kwoka in the Wik. Commons file of same name is not exactly the same; it would be a good idea to rename the Wikipedia version as asked in the template to reduce possibility of deletion; the one in Wik. Commons still has the Museum captions in it and by virtue of that is possibly not in the public domain.  The cropped one w/o the Museum captions has a stronger argument for \"\"public domain\"\" in the U.S.  (The one that is more clearly a photograph of the Museum-captioned photograph has a weaker argument as such, though I am not sure of that.  See the various discussions of the two images linked via the templates.) It is important to correct the conflict/problem pointed out via the templates of the duplicate names for images that have conflicting licenses/fair use rationales in Wik. and Wik. Commons.  If the images are determined by the reviews to be public domain in the U.S., they do not need fair-use rationales; they can be files in Wikipedia Commons (w/o Museum captions/the cropped version currently in this article) and not duplications w/ same name in Wikipedia (??).   \"\n",

Also its true that the modern Bulgarians are nothing turkic, as they are white europeans. Aren't Bulgarians white? Then what race are they? Croats are our closest relatives and they are proven by scientists. Also in many Bulgarian historical books it states clearly that the Bulgarians are closely related to the Hungarians and Croats as they were all part of one tribe in Eastern Europe. To include middle eastern as part of the Bulgarian genetic section is horrendous as it has nothing to do with the Bulgarian people. Mediterranean only partly. There are other evidence that states that Bulgaria has a stronger slavic influence like the Croats and the Slovenes, however there are some sources that claim they are separated from the tight slavic cluster together with the southern croats, serbs, macedonians and romanians. Both different sources should be respected but to include a middle eastern section is beyond belief, its a lie and totally ridiculous. Bulgarians are a mixture of slavic, alpine, dinaric, mediterranean, nordic and pontid. Pontids and the north pontids are about 50% of the population and they are a mix of atlanto mediterranean heritage and nordic people.\n",

While it may be true that the term \"\"is usually used to refer to those [diseases] related to atherosclerosis (arterial disease),\"\" I would suggest that this is careless usage, to which this page need not subscribe. So how should the article be structured? I'd say look to the table of contents of a textbook of CV disease for a model, with the change that I would pull out all atherosclerotic vascular disease into its own section, with links in the relevant anatomic regions.  Other headings might include Congenital Heart Disease, Valvular Heart Disease, Cardiomyopathies, Dysrhythmias and Conduction Abnormalities, Diseases of the Coronary Arteries, Diseases of the Pericardium, Diseases of the Aorta and Great vessels, Brachiocephalic and Cerebrovascular Disease, Other Peripheral Vascular Disease, Arteritides, Systemic Hypertension, Thrombosis and Embolic Disease, Other Venous System Disease, Diseases of the Pulmonary Vasculature, and Heart Failure and Transplantation. Some discussion of cardiovascular anatomy, physiology,diagnosis, and therapy would also be germane. Although each of these would basically be a definition with a link to its own page, I think the result would be to give the reader a better picture of the vast scope of cardiovascular disease.  \"\n",

Causteau's own explanations to you above make his attitude clear, which is that he'll revert anything he can find a reason to revert and he finds people making lots of edits somehow against Wikipedia policy. If necessary, he'll keep looking for new reasons he can experiment with after others are knocked down, and he is willing to revert before he has his argument together as well, on the basis that people should not be edited until he has had his satisfaction.  \"\n",

The United States Board on Geographic Names is the final arbiter in all issues related to geographic names in the United States and their definitive opinion is that Tornado was only ever a variant name for Upper Falls. Thus, my merger of the Tornado, West Virginia article here will only include references to the Tornado Post Office and not the Tornado CDP, which was created in error. It should be noted that the Tornado CDP had most of its population in Lincoln County, while the Upper Falls CDP is contained completely within Kanawha County. Therefore, no comparisons between the two are even possible, as their geographic overlap was relatively tiny. The Tornado CDP was ill-conceived, ill-planned and ill-executed and is now universally acknowledged as such, including by those who did it!\n",

This accounts for the extraordinary doctrinal similarity between some aspects of Islam and the Assyrian Church of the East. For example, according to Assyrian Church doctrine, there is no awareness of passage of time between the moment of death and final judgement; final judgement occurs immediately even though thousands of years may have passed on Earth. Islam holds this same view. It is also noteworthy that the Koran states that in the day of final judgement the angels of Allah will speak to man in Assyrian.http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/timeline.htm''\n",

There seems to be a gang of them, ad they user names are reported frequently around the external Internet that behave in this manner. If you create a beginer edit they revert it, usually with no edit history comment. If you attempt to replace it, figuring it was a vandal (troll elsewhere) and your edit was correct, you get a nasty warning on your user talk page saying roughly \"\"you can't do that and you will get your butt kicked if you do it again\"\". If you persist in editing a few dozen other times, eventually somebody will tell you about BRD, so you try it. You go to the talk page and post your opinion only to be told by some of the same bully team \"\"opinions don't matter here\"\", followed by more cold warnings about being a vandal or other policy, du jour. Next time one attempts to edit and supplies sources for statements by professional people only to be reverted with \"\"not a notable source\"\" or \"\"we don't use primary sources to contradict secondary sources\"\". If you attempt to complaint you get another editor giving you a ban on your talk page and telling you you violated one of the 4,567 WP rules. Sometimes you would attempt to expose or list some of the bias and how it doesn't appear to apply to these bully team members only to get banned again for WP:BLP. I didn't know article rules could apply  to editors personalities behing an imaginary tough edit name, disguise. Last time I attempted to disclose insults on my person and copied them to my talk page the nasty comments not only disappeared from mine and their pages, but the edit histories vanished, as well.  I didn't know this was an option and appears quite deceptive as the wikipedia system seems to keep logs indefinitely. Apparently not for the few dishonest members of the bully team. I laid a complaint against one of this bully team and all I got was WP:Boomerang threats and WP:Stale and WP:BLP warnings from the offending bully, I complained about. I feel I am still suffereing from that as I get regularly visited by one of the same bully team, who hacks up my user page until I complain and then I get banned for WP:BLP or WP:3RR because they coud detect I was thinking about reverting one more time. Another good one is \"\"lack of collaboration\"\" on my own user talk page.  My conclusion is that this bully team exist to attack IP editors on a fear and predjudice basis. This seems to be the usual psychology, on the Internet in forums and real life, unfortunately. People fear the newbie and the unknown, attacking to rid themselves the unknown.  Most of the protection mechanisms are not available to IP editrs and are unknown. The more I educate myself on the ways of WP the more I realize they ren't not applied to IPs equally.

For practical purposes, TT is the same as International Atomic Time (TAI), except there is an offset so the value of TT matches the value of ET on 0 h 0 m 0 s January 1, 1977 TAI (see Resolution A4, Recommendation III in the XXIst General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (1991).\n",

What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.

I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia.

Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings.

Here, for example, are Kulke and Rothermund, in their History of India 4th edition:  The various stages of the indigenous evolution of the Indus civilisation can be documented by an analysis of four sites which have been excavated in more recent years: Mehrgarh, Amari, Kalibangan, Lothal. These four sites reflect the sequence of the four important phases in the protohistory of the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. The sequence begins with the transition of nomadic herdsmen to settled agriculturists in eastern Baluchistan, continues with the growth of large villages in the Indus valley and the rise of towns, leads to the emergence of the great cities and, finally, ends with their decline. The first stage is exemplified by Mehrgarh in Baluchistan, the second by Amri in the southern Indus valley and the third and fourth by Kalibangan in Rajasthan and by Lothal in Gujarat.  In other words, the language changes when IVC is discussed.  \n",

      "OR is one of my favorites. You can add completely relevant, well-sourced text with great informative value, but are explicitly prohibited from doing so, and are thus unable to correct a distorted rendition on a given topic. When editing so called fringe articles, this becomes almost comical. Since fringe by its very definition means that it is outside what is considered mainstream, it is easy to find mainstream articles that criticizes the fringe position, but nigh on impossible to find a mainstream source that counters that position, since the mainstream by and large is critical of that position. So you need to find an article that explicitly counters the (arbitrary chosen) article used by the mainstream editor. Obviously that will be very difficult, since fringe articles are, again, by its very definition, scarce. And if you do find one, the mainstream editor calls on the RS rule, thus ruling out the use of that source because, and here's the kicker, its fringe. And there is nothing you can do about it, because that is what the rules say. Talk about catch 22.\n",

This easy to do, since there's an endless amount of mainstream articles to choose from. These criticisms become virtually impossible to counter because of the OR, RS or some other bullshit rule. According to the rules, it is better to have false and distortive information on the article (provided it is critical) than correct and informative material. This is not the consequence of some manipulation of otherwise good rules and policies, this is the explicit goal and purpose of WP. Truth is not an issue, the High Lord Jimmy Wales tells us, only whatever delusional, bullshit claims that can be \"\"verified\"\" by delusional, bullshit mainstream sources.\n",

But not when it comes to economics. That is a shame, but it is the inevitable consequence of fundamentally flawed rules and policies and the implementation thereof.

He wears a metaphorical mask of normalcy throughout the film, establishing himself as a cool-headed schemer and gaining the trust of those around him (\"\"You are most gracious my liege\"\" - \"\"I assure you your highness, it won't happen again\"\"), despite his rather untrustworthy physical appearance. Even with this mask, Jafar's villainous tendencies tend to seep through and become apparent to the viewer, particularly in the opening sequence, where Jafar displays no remorse in sending Gazim the Thief to his death in the Cave of Wonders, simply proclaiming that \"\"Gazim was obviously less than worthy\"\" in a rather dry tone of voice. The deleted song \"\"Humiliate the Boy\"\" also establishes Jafar as an emotional sadist, getting a laugh out of seeing \"\"another fellow's dreams turn into nightmares one by one\"\" and treating the Genie in an especially harsh manner (one only has to watch the video, a link to which is provided, in which Jafar viciously tugs the genie's beard several times whilst shouting orders like \"\"Do as I say\"\"). It is not until Jafar gains control of the Genie's lamp that he fully shows his true colors, becoming even more arrogant and short-tempered with his subjects after usurping power from the Sultan (\"\"Don't talk back to me you big blue lout! You are to do what I order you to do! Slave). It is this impulsive behavior that leads to his downfall, as he uses his third wish to become an omnipotent genie, unaware of the life inside the lamp that he now has to endure.\n",

It seems to me that the later use of the term is a kind of long tail trailing from the mediaeval usage, so I don't find  it a problem talking about the former in an article about the latter, any more than I see it as a problem talking about film adaptations in articles about books. But you're right that there is something wrong with the hatnote. The problem is that by saying, \"\"This article is about the historical Principality...\"\" we imply strongly that there exists a later principality, which should be covered in some other article. But there isn't; there's just a tail of usage. So you're quite right that we need to change the hatnote, though not I think to \"\"... is primarily about...\"\" which still implies that there's some other principality. But then, do we even need the hatnote at all? We already have, as the last sentence of the introduction, \"\"The term principality is sometimes used in a modern sense to denote all of Wales, but this has no constitutional basis.\"\" Is it too much to hope that a confused person will read that far? If it is too much to hope, then what we need to change in the hatnote is the definite article (which is what implies that there exists some other Principality of Wales). We could do something like this: \"\"This article is about a historical entity (1216-1542). For use of the term \"\"Principality of Wales\"\" to describe Wales after 1542, see below.\"\" Or even: \"\"The Principality of Wales existed from 1216 to 1542; for use of the term to describe Wales after 1542,  see below\"\"   \"\n",

Berg's letters, his language, Marias language and letters, letters such as \"\"Make It Pay\"\" \"\"God's Whores\"\", The King Arthur Series, and many many more, make it clear that FFing was prostitution with a sordid twist of Jesus being behind it all.

Letters like #3029JNR- Loving Jesus Part 3-JETTS is but one letter that has statements showing that certain practices should not be revealed to outsiders. If TFI has nothing to hide, \"\"Burn After Reading\"\" letters would never have been necessary. Despite precautions, publications continue to leak from TFI as people jump ship.

Since you seem to have all the right skills, I wondered whether you might be tempted to work more on the Middleham Hoard article or on other English Civil War hoards with support from York Museums Trust's numismatics curator ? It would be great for our GLAM-wiki partnership to establish direct links between curators and active editors (other than myself!). Particularly ones with specialist knowledge. Any thoughts?

To be honest, I did feel a little put down by your earlier comment; I rather carelessly pulled the offending term out of the air without giving it sufficient thought, for which I apologize.  I don't pretend to be an archaeologist (a couple of digs and a term at university in the late 1970s hardly count), but I enjoy contributing to archaeological articles precisely because I am not an expert in the field, and editing helps me learn more about subjects that interest me.   \n",

Ahmadinejad consistently refers to \"\"the Zionists\"\" and NOT \"\"Israel\"\".  Also, phrases like \"\"Israel should be WIPED OFF THE MAP\"\" are inventions of Zionist-controlled Western media.  Ahmadinejad never said that phrase, and what he was referring to, which was actually a statement of Ayatollah Khomeini roughly translates to \"\"[the usurping regime of Israel] should be eliminated from the page of the world\"\"  one could argue that a good translation for that phrase in English would be \"\"wiped off the map\"\", but that is not what Khomeni had originally said.  Nonetheless, Ahmadinejad was referring to what Khomeini had said and the Western media (in my opinion, Zionist-controlled Western media) suddenly blew it way out of proportion, for obvious reasons.  The history of this article clearly shows that it has been obssessively manipulated by a disproportionate number of Zionists (their edit history shows they are Zionists).

      "And about \"\"Azerbaijanis are Turks or not\"\". Despite you are talking about Persian theory of the roots of Turkish people, we all know that Turks started to migrate here circa 1000 ad when Saljuk Turks of west branch(Oghuz)started to come, but infact it is not important when they came here. The important thing is \"\"EVERY ONE\"\" in Azerbaijan feel themselves as Azerbaijani( and not Azeri which is an invented word by Persians) Turks and believe that they r Turks and speak Turkish lang. as same as Turks of Turkey. You can come here and ask yourself one by one, you will see. It is so irrarational to say to some one that:\"\" No, you r not Turk, you dont know who you are!

But the important thing is, the name of land is not important here as well, the important thing is the people who live in Azerbaijan rep.( former Aran as you called) are of my race and we r same nation. You may call there Azerbaijan or Aran but the important thing is: \"\"here a nation live which called themselves Azerbaijani Turks!\"\". You may call them whatever you want as well as their land, the important thing is what they call themselves.

All of the Turkish names tried to change to a Persian words which looks verbally simmilar them! The fact is Persian never have been to Azerbaijan. Most of the Azerbaijani names have Armenian or Tat roots not Persian. My believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like Tats, Armenians, and other caucasian tribes lived here and then Turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called Azerbaijani Turks nowadays. They have their own culture, music, dance, cuisine etc. which seperate them form Persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of Turks of Anatolia which believes that they r 100 percent Turk!

I only came across the dispute quite recently, although the article was on my watchlist as a vandalism target. This editor insists on writing \"\"jesus\"\" (quotation marks, and lower case) all over the talk page, to make the point that Jesus wasn't a real person, and for a while he was adding a paragraph saying that there was no evidence that he had ever existed. I do recall reading that the agreement was that if articles already had CE, they shouldn't be changed to AD, and if they had AD, they shouldn't be changed to CE. I haven't found the relevant page. I think the dating of the Gospels is more important. I have Robinson, Tresmontant, and Carmignac in the house, but have only skimmed through them. They, as you know, argue for an early date. I can never work out how reliable Brown is supposed to be.

      "\n",
      "Hello, I was just perusing this article randomly and I have a suggestion for the third sentence of the lead paragraph. It reads \"\"Anatomical similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth.\"\" I have two comments on this sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) First, it seems to me that the purpose of the sentence is to lay out, at the highest level, the independent lines of evidence in support of evolution. As such, I think that DNA (or genetic) similarities is a fourth line of independent evidence of the same level of importance as the three lines already listed in the sentence. Certainly, those three lines of evidence are the ones Darwin primarily relied upon when he laid out the theory (actually, he more apologized for the fossil record than relied upon it as an independent source of supporting evidence), but I think the incorporation of genetic evidence into the theory of evolution is at least as important a source of independent evidence and should be included in this sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Secondly, for both anatomical similarities and genetic similarities, it's not so much the similarities per se that are crucial, it's the pattern of those similarities. The article states later that it's the fact that these similarities can be classified into a hierarchy of nested groups that is key to their support of the theory of evolution. I understand the lead isn't supposed to go into all the detail that is laid out later in the article, but I still feel it's crucial to say something about how it's the nature of the similarities that's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might suggest: \"\"A nested hierarchy of anatomical and genetic similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth.\"\" for that sentence.   \"\n",

It would be a bit similar to the \"\"Last of the Time Lords\"\" one we fought over so hard, but unlike in that case, here you'd actually have the \"\"critical analysis\"\" in place, because the scene is covered substantially, and not just in the sense of a renarration of the plot. How about one of those with Rose holding the dying Doctor in her arms, like here, caption along the lines of: \"\"The climactic final scene, described as a \"\"bitter moment of high emotion\"\", as the Doctor is seemingly dying in Rose's arms. (bah, a bit long, but you get my drift.) (Trouble is, if you want it in the infobox, you'll probably want a longish caption to make the analytic significance transparent. In my opinion at least, it really helps if the caption refers explicitly to the analytic aspect, rather than just to the plot.)  ☼ \n",

      "We must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.\n",
      "We cannot question articles about their content, nor can we ask the content questions, but we can ask the proposed contents of the ArbCom questions.\n",
      "Is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to ArbCom membership? If you do not think so, how many of the present ArbCom do you consider stupid? Would a low intellect on ArbCom help or hinder? If there is evidence (a diff) of intellectual failings, does the candidate realise this failing? Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? The questions were politely put. They were challenging, and they were meant to be, and anyone in the community (which includes me) has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. There was no name calling, all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on ArbCom. They were not deferential.

Wikipedia is an international website with editors from all over the world; not everyone will have an opportunity to respond to a talk page comment at any given moment. People work. People study. People eat. And, yes, people sleep. Some people will edit every three hours; others will edit every three days. You cannot just say that because no one has commented in four hours a discussion is closed. I'd suggest waiting five to seven days after the conclusion of a conversation before considering it closed. 300 (film) is a very active article and there clearly are a lot of matters that are as of yet unsettled. The fact that a talk page has reached a certain size is not an automatic license to archive the page, particularly when there is unfinished business. Regarding your pending three-revert rule violation, all of your reverts to 300 (film) contribute to the rule unless you are reverting simple vandalism. That is not what you are doing; you are reverting legitimate edits, so clearly \"\"consensus\"\" has not yet been reached.

And, actually, I do have a similar remark from Raul Hilberg's mouth later in the article, but I don't believe that this entirely addresses POV/NPOV. My point is not to say that the Anschluss cannot be viewed as the military annexation of Austria but that to view it as \"\"simply\"\" that would be to \"\"misunderstand\"\" its essence, which would not in any case provide anything like absolution but does have the effect of changing the subject (hence my wording \"\"tends to conceal\"\"). In any case, to make such a claim without remarking on its limited analytic value and obvious propaganda value would be to set aside a number of basic facts presented elsewhere in the article, and to simply reiterate an argument without quotation or attribution and in any case without pointing out what immediately contradicts it is POV of a subtle sort. Certainly you can always resort to attributing remarks to \"\"some\"\" and \"\"others,\"\" but this is below the Gallup level of presenting opinions and does little to inform the reader or grasp essential truths.

I have put a footnote at the bottom of the chart which says something along the lines of 'every week highest male, female and next highest advanced. Every week, 2 males advanced however it was never revealed which male was the highest and which male won the non-gender specific slot'... Because of this I have replaced 'adv' with 'Top 2' in the cyan colour for male contestants and 'Top' in pink for the female contestants that were non wild-card as we know that they were the highest female vote getters.

I know I did not have the resources available nor the time at the moment to do much with the article; but I was pretty sure that someone would if I tagged it. My editing doesn't involve Civil War articles but only as they are co-incidental the the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the revenue cutters that operated during and immediately after the Civil War and almost all my reference materials involve the USRCS or it's successor agency, the U.S. Coast Guard. As a Kansan interested in Kansas history I realize that the origins of the Civil War began as far back as the Missouri Compromise and later with the Kansas-Nebraska Act. As a Kansan, one is sometimes referred to as a 'Jayhawk' and that is how I ran across the article on Quantrill's Raiders. It was interesting to me, but I saw NPOV issues with it. Anyway, thanks for your edits and when you feel that the article has been edited enough to warrant removal of the tag, you certainly have my blessing. Cuprum17 (talk) \n",

And this being the American version of Wikipedia I would think that this link could be added as well. I noticed that the link-page which is on the Norwegian version of this Edvard Munch website, isn't in the English version, and this page cites books and websites as the sources of both images and text. Now, I can see that one may hesitate to link to a website like this, but if one were to deny every similar website (in other subjects/articles) to be linked to when the content is of such importance as it is here, Wikipedia wouldn't be much to look at -) You can find - probably thousands - of links of the same kind in all kinds of subjects and articles on Wikipedia. But as I said, I don't want to start an argument about this, I just think it's interesting to look into a case like this. What can and what can't be linked to... It's no big deal for me personally, but Wikipedia should set a standard and stick to it 100 percent. I just feel that the public should be able to see some other artworks of Edvard Munch than just The Scream and The Madonna... Especially when the artist has been dead for over 60 years (in regarding of copyright in several countries). Oh, well... Time for a cup of coffee -) ( )\n",

Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper context. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article.

      "Andy, thank you very much! )  What are the locations of those lost buildings?  All in Aachen?  I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?\n",

The Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia through Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE is an on going Anthropological interest.[9] The Samoan origins are currently being thoroughly assessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.\n",

Things like this would be more obvious to you if you were not so constrained by your self-imposed concentration on one article. They would also be more obvious if you actually tried discussing things with other people and listening to what they say.

If this is the case, then there could, in fact, be negative mass with positive gravitational energy, which behaves in an opposite manner. I would presume that annihilation due to matter-antimatter interactions would have gravitational energy considerations as well - but in any case, the mere fact that negative mass would accelerate in a different direction in a gravitational field does not in itself preclude its existence, especially since gravitational laws were formulated without accounting for this eventuality.\n",

E-mail lists shouldn't even be seen as credible sources, not to mention \"\"primary\"\" sources for a biographical entry in an encyclopedia. I would also point out that the entry on me is way too long for somebody who is not as famous as other people who don't even have Wikipedia entries.  \"\n",

I mean, this whole site is a basic free for all and anyone and everyone can do anything and everything to it.  So why is it that when someone adds a photo to it, they've got to get permission to use it.  Now myself I look at this as a waste of time because of the simple fact that there are a zillion photos of anything and everything out there that people use.  As long as you are giving credit to where you got it, I don't see the big deal.  Now that is the same thing with anything and everything that is on this site.  If you the powers that be want to be so picky about photos, why aren't they picky about the information that people put in the entries.  I mean, I've gone on to some people's bios and shows and have seen things literally plagiarized, word for word from one source or another.

      "I maintain that the article, in its current form, reads like a sanitized Vatican press release.  Even if all of the arguments I've presented here are seen to carry no weight, I fail to see how the wealth of reliable sources that I've sited have been so readily dismissed as irrelevant, giving not so much as a single mention within the body of the article.  And aside from the one's I had highlighted, there were plenty of reliable sources reporting on the December VatiLeaks Dossier, with that document's connection to the resignation decision.  I find it shocking to see so many editors here to not want a single mention of any of that.  So the decision for now is to continue presenting an article on Benedict's resignation as though there was absolutely no connection to any of the scandals, and to pretend that all of the reliable sources that do point to such connections don't exist.

As anyone can easily ascertain by studying this article's history, and as you well know, I was only the last of several editors to write, maintain, or modify that section, without removing it. The others who worked on it  who outnumbered you and your confederates  either didn't feel like wasting their time on a flame war with your group, or were unaware of your vandalous campaign. So much for your mythic statement about \"\"community opinion.\"\" (The term for the rhetorical dodge in which one claims  popular support for an opinion, is \"\"bandwagoning.\"\" There is probably a separate term for the parallel strategy of portraying dissenters as lone cranks, but I don't know it offhand.)\n",

As anyone who follows life in South Africa knows, such daily race-based attacks, and official indifference towards them, are a part of the institutionalized fabric of that nation's life.

      "In 2001 Hurley was replaced as the face of Estee Lauder with Carolyn Murphy. However, Hurley stayed on with Estee Lauder and in doing so, ended the tradition of the company having a 'face'...after all, there were 2 faces. In the years following, Gwyneth Paltrow and Liya Kebede also joined the company as models, rounding out 4 faces. Currently, the company is fronted by Murphy, Hillary Rhoda, Paltrow and Hurley. The phrase 'lesser capacity' is misleading. Hurley models perfume, cosmetics and skincare for the company, something which Ms Murphy does not do (she does not model cosmetics), nor does Ms Paltrow (who does not model skincare). Only Ms Rhoda models all 3 as Ms Hurley does, but Ms Rhoda does not serve as the face of Estee Lauder's Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign. Thus, it is not that Hurley works in a 'lesser' capacity, she simply works in a 'different' capacity, in actual fact, her workload has increased! Therefore, I am changing the phrase 'lesser' to my original edit that she 'remained with the company'.\n",

      "\":: This discussion belongs to years ago, so I hope that my comment will still be helpful. First of all, a necessary preamble: consonants in Italian can be double or single, as is well known; however, what is often overlooked in this description is that this contrast can only occur in certain positions, i.e. in between vowels or between a vowel and a \"\"semivowel\"\" (/w/ and /j/) or, for plosives, between a vowel and \"\"r\"\"/\"\"l\"\"; in all other position all consonants have an indeterminate length. So in the word \"\"pasto\"\" (\"\"meal\"\") neither the \"\"s\"\" nor the \"\"t\"\" can be described as being \"\"single\"\" or \"\"double\"\", they have an intermidiate, indeterminate length (pronouncing something like \"\"passto\"\" or \"\"pastto\"\" would be meaningless in Italian phonology, unlike other languages featuring geminate consonants like Finnish). So, applying this concept to the pronunciation of \"\"r\"\": single \"\"r\"\" is pronounced as a flap, double and indeterminate \"\"r\"\" are pronounced as a trill in standard pronounciation; for example \"\"caro\"\" (dear) contains a flap, while \"\"terra\"\" (earth) and \"\"treno\"\" (train) both contain a trill. You can check this listening to the entries of the \"\"Dizionario di Ortografia e Pronuncia\"\", published by the Italian state television RAI and which is (or used to be) available on this page. Using the trill in \"\"caro\"\", no matter how short, would inevitably turn it into \"\"carro\"\" (charriot). \n",
      "I am a native speaker, I've taught Italian to foreigners and I have studied and compared Italian phonology in depth. Of course, this claims are not sufficient for wikipedia, but there's an inherent problem when referencing publications on the subject. For long time phonology has been considered in Italy just a lesser part of grammar; more importantly, most study focussed on internal controversies and variations, i.e. describing the language from within the language, a more objective and scientific study of the phonetics is quite limited. It suffices to say that even IPA has hardly ever been used in the description of Italian phonetics, many authors using custom phonetic conventions even in promimenent works (such as the one I linked before). This means that while the contrast between /e/ and /ɛ/ or /ɔ/ and /o/ is widely discussed in many pubblication because there's a lot of variation in distribution, little work can be found about other distinctive traits of Italian phonology that are uniform or nearly so among native speakers (e.g. the assimilation of place of articulation of \"\"n\"\" with the following consonant; the lengthening of the vowel in stressed, open syllables inside words; phonetic value of syllables like in /pas.to/ contrasting with the prescribed orthographic split \"\"pa-sto\"\", syllable-timed rythm, etc.). The difference of distribution of flap vs trill for \"\"r\"\", as well as an accurate description of consonants of incontrastive length in general, has been largely disreguarded.   \n",

This is why they're talking 1-2 week timelines whereas before they've been been screwing with the MMA community for months with an incomplete doc while AfD'ing everything in sight. Of course, short-tracking necessarily means they'll railroad the MMA voices against. If they don't get the short-track, their plan is essentially dead, which is why they'll show a tiny bit of leeway in the short term to get what they want in the long term. What's most notable is that even if they get what they want, it doesn't mean they don't AfD again right after they get approval. Their plan has no brightline rules, and it's vague and open to interpretation (which is why AfD are effective now).

Then those who really care about intricacies and details of the chiropractic story can get on with the show and make the article interesting and not some big stats/research battleground.  For the record, I completely agree 100% that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders (just as good if not better) that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain (Task Force 2008) that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches (TTH, migraine, cervicogenic/headache of cervical origin) and inconclusive and controversial for non-musculoskeletal disorders.  Part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for LBP.  This is the most succint and precise summary there is.  We can toss the reference in and call it a day.  A majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence, both in research and 3rd parties (governments) favours chiropractic care.  We can't let Ernst' conclusions (which have been rebutted and invalidated) skew what is now generally accepted.  Notice the terms too, generally, etc.\n",

      "Hello, I notice you're using one of the  templates, run by Wikipedia:Motto of the day. You may have noticed that some of the mottos recently have been followed by a date from 2006, or on occasion simply \"\"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\"\". The reason for this is that Motto of the day is in some very serious need of help. Participation in the project, which has never been especially high, has dropped considerably over this past summer, to the point we have had several days where no motto was scheduled to appear at all. Over the past several weeks, I've been the only editor scheduling mottos at all, but there aren't enough comments on some of these mottos to justify their use. If we do not get some help - and soon - your daily mottos will stop. In order for us to continue updating these templates for you, we need your help.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you get a chance between your normal editing, could you stop by our nominations page and leave a few comments on some of the mottos there, especially those that do not have any comments yet? This works very simply; you read a motto, decide whether or not you like it, and post your opinion just below the motto. That's it - no experience required, just an idea of what you personally like and what you feel reflects Wikipedia and its community. If you do have past experience with the project, then please close some of the older nominations once they've got a decent consensus going. There are directions on the nominations page on how to do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have any questions, please let me know, or post on the project's talk page. I'm looking forward to reading your comments on the suggested mottos, and any additional suggestions you'd like to make. Until then, happy editing!  (//c) \"\n",

      "I'm still very unhappy about this Wikipedia page on Cyclothymia and I see that it has got even worse recently due to these copy-right problems. People will naturally be turning to Wikipedia as a first step to find out something about Cyclothymic Personality Disorder and they will be unaware of the controversies surrounding it e.g. that it is even disputed to be a personality disorder. http://s13.zetaboards.com/TheCollective/index/ and http://www.chatarea.com/TheCyclothymiaCollective appeared to have died since I last visited them so active discussion with other people who have been diagnosed or hope to be diagnosed is not presently possible, so let me offer this letter for the casual enquirer to read about the actual symptoms of somebody who has been diagnosed as Cyclothymic. The reader will note from the complaint above that I am unhappy that the main article does not contain any warning about such 'mixed state' Cyclothymia which frequently causes misdiagnosis as depression resulting in medication with anti-depressants which makes the condition worse. My attempt to rectify that state of affairs resulted in my contribution being removed, so I will not waste any time on making a new ammendment. Please be kind enough to leave this in the discussion though. The following is not for diagnostic purposes but solely to provide the enquirer with a taste of the sorts of symptoms that can be diagnosed as Cyclothymia. I was diagnosed 16 years after the onset of these symptoms, and this is a letter applying to volunteer to be the subject of some research conducted by my local university.\n",

      "I recently participated in the Beating Bipolar research, I was in the control group. I was handed a letter inviting me to participate in your research involving an MRI scan which intrigues me. I was intending to write this email several weeks ago but I put it off because I wanted to write you an account of what happens to me in my disorder that has been diagnosed as Cyclothymia. Since I am not getting around to writing you a longer account let me write you a short account, because I would very much like to be put in that MRI scan twice. Once I know that I am becoming hyperthymic ( hypomanic ) I can roughly predict when I am going to be hypothymic ( depressed ). This is because my cycles are extremely regular - given a distinct stress such as losing a job or starting a relationship I can mark out in advance on a calender when I will be high ( at end of the fifth week following ) and when I will be low ( at the end of the seventh week following ) and when I will come out on a level again ( at the end of the twelth week following ). I've always felt that the mechanical predictability of this should intrigue researchers, and I believe that what has happened to me is that the stress response mechanism has had its period reset. This first happened when I was 19 circa September 1981 and has continued ever since, but it took me until I was 25 to clearly identify that it was a cycle because it had disrupted my life so much. Originally I believed that I was dealing with the sort of kaleidoscope of problems that perhaps are typical of young people but having dealt with those problems with various counselling psychologies I was left facing a problem that could not be taken away. By the age of 35 I was chronically depressed because of the host of problems that came in its wake - unemployment, poverty, social isolation and depression - and my doctor at the time wrote me off onto Sick Benefit. This resulted in an interview with the Department of Social Security doctor who not only recognised that I was being discriminated against in employment but diagnosed me as having cyclothymia of a mixed state variety and recognised that doctors had kept interpretting my presenting symptoms as acute depression. I have since been moved onto Incapacity Benefit and have been monitored by a psychiatrist ever since, presently Dr X of the Community Mental Health Team in the X clinic.\n",

Indeed, critical views of the origins story are relegated deep within the article as a single sentence, while the Church's story is accorded several paragraphs.  I suggest condensing the \"\"Origins\"\" section and renaming it.  The section should contain a single paragraph (no more than three or four sentences) describing the Church's origin story.

As it stands, there is only the Church-sponsored view of the Book's origin and no others.  (  )\"\n",

      "P.S. On further reflection, I see that there is at least one point that I clearly overstated in our discussion. Sources for 2000s (decade) do not, in fact, have to be explicitly about the decade. They can be about, say, events that happened at some point during the decade. For example, a retrospective source about the 21st century, published before 2010, almost certainly is acceptable as a source about the 2000s. It is, after all, from these types of sources that time lines are constructed. Beneath my cynical tone (as it strikes me now in retrospect) was the idea that one can't infer too much from sources, as such inference might amount to original research. If a source says that X is characteristic of the 21st century or of modernity in general, that source (at least in principle) certainly may be used to help put the 2010s decade (insofar as it is part of the 21st century and of modernity) into context. Statement X just shouldn't be used clearly to characterize item A on Wikipedia, when it clearly is meant to characterize item B in the source. This probably is what I should have said back in January, and I apologize for making my case in such an inflected voice. Also, I take it that your first language is not English, so I should have been more sensitive to the possibility of unintentional offense. While I don't know for a fact that you took offense at all, I'm troubled by the correspondence between our discussion and your departure from the project. Please, once more, accept my sincere apologies for any actions on my part that might have discouraged your participation.\n",

      " It would be useful if you dated your comments, it's much easier to follow the dates that way, rather than checking the history. I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.\n",
      "\n",
      " That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.\n",
      "\n",
      " Let me explain what I mean with my \"\"intuitiveness\"\" concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply \"\"antigravity\"\" to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's \"\"beating\"\" some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to \"\"beat\"\" as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn't really exist, that confuses the reader (\"\"then what's the force that I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn't get it right...\"\") and s/he's most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  \"\n",

But then later in the article, it talks about breaking people of the habit of the pressing the accelerator pedal.  Maybe I'm one of those operators of older vehicles talked about, but I still press the accelerator when I start my car, whether it's fuel-injected or not.  So it seems like in the same description, it's trying to make the car start like an ICE vehicle, and yet not make it start like an ICE vehicle.\n",

I'm also not sure what the short blue wire between \"\"Run Buss\"\" and \"\"Run:\"\" is for.  My guess is that it's for other systems that are activated only when the ignition state has been latched, but the text doesn't make that clearand this also added to my confusion about the In Cab being a component.\n",

      " Finally, I had to think about diode D1.  When the key switch is in the Start position and both relays are enabled, there will be 12V on each side of the diode.  Therefore the diode won't conduct, since one side isn't lower in voltage than the other.  When the key switch is then returned to the On position, the Alarm-Start Relay will open, removing the +12V on the negative side of the diode, so the diode will start conducting, thus keeping the Latch Relay energized.  Is that correct?  If so, maybe an explanation could be added to that effect for dummies like me.  If not, then perhaps add a description of the way it really works.\n",

      "Answer: In 1925 most people did not even believe there were electrons. There is no spin, no electrons. It is a radiation pressure. Seccond, there is no such thing as having an N one place and an S in anther place. they are apart of the same magnet. How the magnet is connected will affact the experiment, so it needs to be displayed how that is. It is possible the are from two different magnets, in which case there are also magnetic fields around the experiment.  Seccond in the regionN S, there is a tension, like a compressed spring. When the radiation leaves the mass, it is effected by the tension. This experiment proves electrons dont have a negative charge. They dont exist. Radiation, has a direct effect on magnetism, and this experiment, needs to be redone, and explored.\n",

      "I don't want to go about beating around a dead Bantha, but after reviewing the sequence of the transformation on DVD I discovered something interesting when viewing the scene in slow motion within chronological order. In one shot, we see Palpatine's face becoming the Sidious of the OT, followed by more lightning to the face. After a few close-ups on a conflicted Anakin, the camera focuses back on Palpatine, who is still in a transitional state but is lacking the details present in the previous shot. It is as if the Sidious face is showing through once as the lightning is interacting with the skin, and then fading away, and then finally breaking through again as the Palpatine face melts away and Sidious says he's too weak to continue. If Palpatine was indeed literally deformed by the lighting, why did his face go from normal, to Sidious, to semi-normal, and back to Sidious again. If the lightning wounded him, wouldn't the wounds stay instead of suddenly disappearing and re-appearing? Watch your DVDs, you'll see it. I have a few screen shots that I can provide to show you what I am referring to. By the way, both this and the regular Wikipedia article fail to make any mention of Sidious' strange voice after he rises from the window sill and before he puts on his hood. In the commentary, Lucas said he added synthesized effects to the voice to make the \"\"true Sidious\"\" drip a bit more menace. That's all well and good, but there must be a within-universe explanation for it.\"\n",

      "====I agree. The explanation given by the OP makes no sense. I have sailed these waters many, many times. If you are off \"\"Kanagawa\"\" in Sagami Bay, then Fuji San is to the northwest and Edo (Tokyo) is the to north northeast. The boats are moving to the southeast towards the coast of the Izu peninsula. Because of Fuji San's height above sea level and the reflectivity of snow you do not have to be due east of the mountain to observe a spectacular sun rise. Further confusing the issue, the \"\"Kanagawa\"\" in the title of the print does not refer to Kanagawa Prefecture. Kanagawa Prefecture was established in 1876. Prior to that time, the easternmost part of what is now Kanagawa Prefecture was known as the Province of  Musashi. The westernmost part was known as the province of Sagami. The title may refer to an area in Musashi Province near what is now the city of Yokohama. The problem with this is that you do not see waves of this size in the confined waters of Tokyo Bay. You are only going to see them in Sagami Bay which is consistent with the geography in the print. Perhaps Hokusai was exercising artistic license or perhaps he was reinterpreting something he had heard or been told. Or perhaps he chose the name because it was more recognizable than some of the other locations he might have used.  \"\n",

      "Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland image is dubious\n",
      "\n",
      "The image depicted of the Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland is ahistorical and a creation by its author based on his interpretation of a coat of arms motif that appears on The Custom House completed in 1791 in Dublin. While a gold harp on a blue shield with a crown surmounting the shield was sometimes used by the government in Ireland, the stonework on this building that portrays the shield of Ireland in a stylistic way with the supporters for England (a lion) and Scotland (a unicorn) is simply heraldic artwork and not a proper coat of arms of the said kingdom. The Kingdom of Ireland created by Henry VIII never had its own unique royal coat of arms. i.e. a full armorial achievement. After 1603 and the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland, the royal arms of James I of England (James VI of Scotland) did include a harp for Ireland in the third quarter. the image in question is loosely based on the current UK royal arms. It was created by simply placing the shield for Ireland as the sole shield and retaining the Order of the Garter collar, St Edward's Crown, supporters and royal motto of the current UK coat of arms (which is not in this depiction in its the full armorial achievement format as it is missing the helm, crest and compartment). It is noteworthy that the creator refers to the crown as the \"\"imperial crown\"\" - which is anachronistic as there was no British Empire during the Kingdom of Ireland period. While I think the creator was sincere in thinking this was indeed the historical coat of arms for the Kingdom of Ireland from 1541 until the Act of Union 1801, Ireland - unlike Scotland - did not have its own royal coat of arms during this period. When the then Anglo-Irish parliament met for the last time before the Union of 1801, it did not request a separate royal coat of arms for use in Ireland as Scotland did almost a century before in the Act of Union 1707. If anyone has evidence to the contrary, I would be most interested to learn about it.   \"\n",

      "It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had be\n",

      "Sinanoğlu was born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy, where his father (Nüzhet Haşim Sinanoğlu) served as a consul general. In 1939 - at the beginning of World War II - the family returned to Turkey. He graduated high school in Turkey in the year 1953. This high school's name was \"\"Ankara Maarif College\"\" since 1951.[7] The courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in this school had been given by English teachers in the English language since 1949.[8][9] Sinanoglu learned the English language very well in this high school.\n",

      "Serving American Military Intelligence at the age of 18\n",
      "\n",
      "In his autobiographical book entitled \"\"Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book,\"\" which was published in Turkey in the Turkish language (first printing in October 2001 and 70. printing in April 2011, a bestseller: 150,000 copies), he stated that, in the summer holiday 1952-1953, he applied to the JAMMAT \"\"Joint American Military Mission for Aid to Turkey\"\" (renamed JUSMMAT in 1958)[10][11][12] to get a job as a translator. His application was accepted by the U.S. Army Staff in Ankara, and he was sent on duty to Erzurum as translator for Secret G2 Military Intelligence Agents Sergeant Kowalski and Sergeant Peterson.[13] After graduating high school in 1953, a scholarship was given to him by the Fulbright Program to study chemistry in the United States.[14] According to the agreement, students were elected by the U.S. Education Commission in Turkey, but funding of the scholarship was provided by the government of Turkey, because Turkish students will return after graduation in the U.S.A to become teachers in Turkey. Sinanoglu was sent with this expectation to the U.S.A.\n",
      "\n",
      "A University Student in the U.S.A. (1953-1960)\n",
      "\n",
      "He arrived in New York on September 25, 1953.[15] According to his autobiographical book mentioned above, he stayed one year in Missouri [clarification needed], after which he went to California and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956, with highest honors in chemical engineering. Afterwards, in eight months, he earned a Master's degree with highest honors from MIT (1957); and after this, in two years, he finished his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley (1959).[16] Subsequently, he finished a one-year postdoctoral research appointment at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California Berkeley (1959-1960).[17] So, his pupilage ended in 1960.\n",

      "Violating Scholarship Agreement and Military Service Obligation to Live in the U.S.A.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the 1953 scholarship agreement, after graduation, Sinanoglu was obligated to return to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students.[18] Sinanoglu stated in his autobiographical book that: \"\"Returning to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students in the English language was worse than death, a horrible and dishonorable thing. İnstead of this, to stay in the U.S.A. and to teach chemistry to American students in the English language was a more honorable thing. I swore that: I will not return to Turkey; I will stay in the U.S.A and I will be a chemistry teacher in American universities.”[19] So Sinanoglu violated the 1953 scholarship agreement and did not return to Turkey. But there was a second problem: According to the military service obligation laws of his country, after finishing his studies in 1960, Sinanoglu was to return to Turkey to fulfill an 18-month military service obligation. The penalty for violating the scholarship agreement was a fine: the payment of a sum of money. But the penalty for violating one's military service obligation was the cancellation of one's passport and visa; this penalty could not be paid by money in those years (1960s). He stated in his autobiographical book: \"\"Theoretical Physicist Feza Gursey wrote a letter to me inviting me to the Middle East Technical University which was being established in Ankara, Turkey. But I couldn't return to Turkey because of the military service obligation. If I went to Turkey, I would be a soldier for 2-2,5 years.\"\"[20] An easy way to stay in the U.S.A. was to marry and father a child in that country.\n",

According to that motion, a \"\"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors\"\" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action.

      "Georgewilliamherbert's reason for blocking me relied solely upon the idea that i personally attacked Nableezy by accusing him of \"\"supporting terrorism\"\". from an absolutist POV, nowhere in any edit was the word \"\"terrorism\"\" even mentioned. my observation that nableezy's political POV on wikipedia aligns with the political goals of hamas was by no means meant as a personal attack, nor to insinuate the more abstract idea of nableezy's support for terrorism. my primary intention was to highlight nableezy's possible WP:COI with the subject while he was pushing to have negative information about it removed. my main point here is that i find george's reasoning for my block to have been rather arbitrary and ambiguous.also, the duration of the blocks handed out seems somewhat irrational. nableezy, a user with a lengthy history of often thinly veiled and sometimes outright personal attacks not to mention numerous complaints about their civility, was given only a token block of three hours for a direct personal attack . whereas i have no significant or pertinent history of incivility and was blocked for 16 times that length (48 hours) for what some have misconstrued as a personal attack based on the wholly fabricated idea that i called someone a \"\"terrorism supporter\"\". not to mention nableezy plainly knew that his blatant personal attack would result in a ban, where i went to some length to clarify that my comment was not a personal attack. also, i did not respond when nableezy attacked me directly, and i was the first user to drop the argument and bring the discussion back to the topic at hand .i really cannot stress enought the fact that i never accused nableezy of \"\"supporting terrorism\"\", not only did i never directly say this, it was never even implied by my comments. thus it would seem my block was based entirely on a misconception of what was meant when i said \"\"nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause, and by association hamas\"\"  implying this was actually instead intended to say \"\"nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause, and by association terrorism\"\". this is simply not the case, and frankly i am somewhat offended myself at george's insinuation that i would arbitrarily class\n",

What I'm seeing is gross abuse on each side of the story. You and Willmcw are no better than Jonah and his many aliases- which for the record i find offensive. Furthermore, your quote on my talk page is erroneous. You don't know exactly who I am. I came to this place to write about things near and dear to me. The Biff Rose edits have generateda little bit of notoreity with those that know him, as i'm sure you are aware. Biff is largely responsible for that. he likes to spread his fame. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've noticed on the pages and pages and pages of talk about Biff that you've been every bit as antagonistic and as the Jonah Ayer/ Steve espinola ones. You seem to try and trap them into bad behavior. But you do it in such a manner that is inappropriate here on wikipedia. mind oyu, I've not been on here for as long as you have, guessing from the timetable of your postings. I can say this, by being so incredibly hardheaded about Biff, you end up becoming less of a standard bearer for the moral right side of the street, and seem akin to whom you accuse. Willmcw believes your point of view, and you his, and that's unfortunately created a definition of biff that even hhe himself must be getting a hoot from. \n",

      "You don't know me. Maybe you've been to the same bar where I once worked, maybe you even ordered a drink from me, maybe I chatted you up. But that certainly doesn't give you the right to claim knowledge of me. I think that's offensive, as offensive as Jonah Ayers or whoever he is claiming that Biff was a child molester. I'm a nice person and I think that's what happens with Biff. He finds nice people to glom up to, and eventually the true nature of his personality comes to the front, and it's not such a clearly angelic personality as I'm sure you've seen if you ever had to spend any amount of time with him at all, when he was drinking. he was a paying customer at two bars I worked at, and so I had to stomach some rather base and quite frankly aberrantly sexist remarks from him, on a regular basis. It was people like him that helpeed me decide that it was time to leave the city of New Orleans. Another one was Barry Cowsill, who sadly has gone missing since Katrina hit. Barry however had an excuse; he was diagnosed as Bi polar, and when he was off his meds and drinking, there was nothing he could do to mend his behavior. Biff had no medical diagnosis to alter my opinion of him. The cases are similar because both men experienced some minor amount of notoreity due to their musical prowess, and were not able to channel that into permanent success like many of their contemporaries, lesser talents who had much better managers or agents. Southern Louisiana is peppered with what are known as almost weres and has beens. Sugarboy Crawford, whose song Iko Iko you might know, stopped performing after a steel plate was implanted in his head after a brutal beating at the hands of white police officers. James Booker, one of the most noted pianists to play in the New Orleans style died on a hospital gurney after getting himself to Charity Hospital in the middle of over  dosing on heroin, only to be left ot his own devices for six hours, in which time he died. The thing is, those men were not only major influences on the culture of their time and place, but on further generations after they were no longer playing. Both  Barry and Biff may well have influenced others, but never to the degree of the other two men I mentioned. That doesn't make them lesser artists, just less influential. Not one of the four of them had very big sales at any point of their careers. However when I got the chance to meet Sugarboy Crawford, he was kind and courteous. And he stayed that way, no matter how many times he nipped from the bottle wrapped in brown paper in his hip pocket. \n",

I found that most of them had experienced some degree of shell shock from having worked in the confines of the recording industry, and yet still seemed to be wonderstruck. Again, Biff fit right in; again, at first. But I found that many more of them continued to develop their skills, and work in the industry or on the fringe of it, because music was in their blood.

Further, the Alder Creek digs say nothing about other incidents of cannibalism by Donner Party members at the lake camp, among the \"\"Forlorn Hope\"\" snowshoers, or at Starved Camp. Survivors said they ate human flesh and rescuers saw the evidence. Donner Party cannibalism is not in doubt among anyone who is familiar with the incident; it's the general public who have misinterpreted the archaeological evidence as \"\"casting doubt\"\" on cannibalism. DPL, 6/28/2007\n",
      "\n",
      "Cannibalism in the Donner Party is not in question. Ten survivors said they ate human flesh. At the Donner family camp at Alder Creek, the Donners told the First Relief that they were going to start eating the bodies of the dead; when the Second Relief arrived at Alder Creek they saw children eating human flesh and mutilated corpses. Three Alder Creek survivors (Georgia Donner, Mary Donner, and Jean-Baptiste Trudeau) said that cannibalism had occurred at the Donner camp. This is not a legend, but a matter of record. People who are unfamiliar with the historical sources are not competent to dismiss them as \"\"legends.\"\" Kristin Johnson, author Unfortunate Emigrants: Narratives of the Donner Party (Logan: Utah State University Press, 1996).\n",

      "As a little footnote I'd like to add that cannibalism WAS a big part of the story. The website that is footnoted on that sentence shows about 6 episodes of eating people. Some of them ate human flesh for a month! And even the site admits it's a \"\"brief\"\" section of their crazy feeding habits! Donner is forever known for eating others and the fact that it wasn't just 1 or 2 bodies, but like approx. 7-8+? really shows that these people had an appetite for homoerectus! 72.219.137.83  \n",

      "As a little footnote, I'd like to add that you don't know what you're talking about. A year elapsed between the time the emigrants left home and the day the last survivor was rescued. With one exception, those who ate human flesh did so for about 2 weeks, some for as little as 2-3 days. Two weeks, out of 52 weeks in a year, IS minor. They did NOT \"\"develop an appetite for homo erectus\"\" or a \"\"crazy eating habit\"\"  they put off eating human flesh for as long as they could, until finally there was absolutely nothing else left to eat. The reason why \"\"Donner is known forever for eating others\"\" is because the general public, like the commentator above, exults in its own ignorance.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 144.35.8.13   \n",

The fact that the PRoC is currently trying to dissociate their government from \"\"China\"\" (which seems counter intuitive for a totalitarian regime..) is an interesting thing to mention in the article on the PRoC at China. If we change the name of the article to follow political correctness of the PRoC that is an express act of support for their policy.

I imagine that there are some Native Americans who dislike the term (just as some, maybe even more understandably, hate the word \"\"Indian\"\"), just as there are some who find the terms white, black, and yellow offensive.  (Though \"\"yellow\"\" is probably a special case, since it is sometimes associated with cowardice, there are still some contexts in which few if any people would be offended by it, such as in \"\"all people, whether White, Black, Red, or Yellow, should be treated equally\"\", in which the usage is very explicitly non-derogatory.)\n",

Likewise, in areas where Native Americans are the largest racial \"\"minority\"\", there has probably already been a long history of mutual cooperation and friendship between the Whites and \"\"Redskins\"\" of the area (and many Whites who very proudly boast a Native herritage), who would not immediately think any word was intended pejoratively unless given good reason to do so.  I know in my area, where racism against Mexicans and Asians is somewhat common (and sadly, even expected), the idea of racism against Natives is strange and alien, since the Whites and the Redskins here have such a long history together and such a strong respect for one another.  Although that might also have to do with the fact that most of the cities in my area were founded by Scottish and Irish immigrants who were treated as outcasts in the rest of the U.S., so the Whites who settled here in the early years knew first-hand how hurtful prejudices and stereotypes could be.\n",

There is criticism of Jefferson for not speaking out on emanicipation during his Presidency, his reluctance to free his slaves, his reliance on slavery to support his aristocratice lifestyle, his rhetoric contradicting his slave ownership, and the Louisiana Purchase treaty increased slavery in the West. Positive statements on Jefferson was that he was a humane slaveowner, mentioning his proposal to stop slavery in the West after 1800, and he banned the United States slave trade. Editors can address any other issues without the neutrality dispute tag. The article does state he manummitted only a few slaves. As far as \"\"humane\"\" that is a matter of subjection.

This contrary evidence and contradiction in Zimmerman's story should be noted in this wiki article.  Speculation is that Zimmerman achieved standing (off the ground from a lying down position) status after Martin's struggled with him and then shot him with his 9mm as payback for the beating upon himself which he had apparently initiated.

Editors are explicitly forbidden to base articles or edits on their opinions. It's the sources which count. While there are relaible third party sources all pointing one way and no sources offering the contrary view, there is no need for debate. And, contrary to what Twilde says, the word populism is not \"\"loaded, subjective and deeply ambiguous\"\". Used by political scientists and commenators it has a very precise meaning. If some readers do not understand it, that is their problem and they need to find out more by reading the works of experts, but it is no reason to do away with it.   \"\n",

      "Oh yes, there are quite a few ways to handle that sort of thing. At its simplest, click on the history tab to see a list of all the edits made to an article in reverse chronological order. Then click on the date&time; of the last good edit to see the page as it used to be (in this case, that would be click on the 22:15, 9 September 2005 edit by User:Tsemii but avoid clicking on the username itself). Now click 'edit this page' and in addition to the normal edit box you should also see a warning at the top that you are editing an out of date version of the page. That's OK, in this case it is what you want. Don't make any changes to the text, just enter an edit summary like 'reverting to last good version by xxxx' or 'rv test', press the 'save page' and you are done.\n",
      "Another way, is to bring up the page history, then click on the word 'last' to the left of the bad edit. This should bring up a page like this highlighting differences made by the bad edit. You can get a similar page by clicking the 'diff' link from your watchlist. Then clicking on 'Revision as of 22:15, 9 September 2005' at the top of the left panel, will take you to the earlier good version, and you can make a null edit and save as before. The advantage of using this page difference approach is that there are also links to go forward and back to newer and older edits. So if a vandal has made a series of bad edits you can keep stepping back until you reach a good version of the article before editing and saving to revert to that version.\n",
      "If a user is looking like being a problem, you can drop them a note on their talk page, asking them to stop. There are a number of templates for boilerplate warning messages which escalate from  to . Typically if a user has recently had one of the earlier test warning, you add the next one in the sequence and sign it. However, if you are reaching test4, its a good idea to get an admin involved because the next step is to block them.\n",
      "If you have the time, you can also check the user's other contributions to see whether they have been messing up any other pages, and if they have, revert those pages too. However, if they look like being a particularly busy vandal, its usually best to get help from an admin at Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress, because admins have some extra 'rollback' buttons to make it much easier to undo a large number of changes.\n",
      "I've reverted the particular edit at Agricultural machinery, but this one just looks like a harmless test, so no further action was needed. Many anon users still find it hard to believe that their changes really are for real and immediately visible to everyone. So we see a lot of random edits like this.\n",

Secondly, I am not sure that I agree with the talk page reason you give for keeping the header, as it includes original research (private interpretation of primary sources) and citations of a publication that might not even apply to all of the books listed, e.g., how does a 1980's Kingdom Ministry support the statement that \"\"Studies in the Scriptures is intended to convert interested individuals\"\"?

If you look at that page it is a very long list of airlines, but if you try to edit it you will see it is actually just a bunch of sublists on separate pages put together. My proposal is to have the main page List of World War I flying aces, and then many subpages List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (A-F) List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (G-Q), List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (R-Z), etc. (I chose those names based on other list series, and so that they will be able to stand as lists on their own.) Each list will then need some extra coding, which I can do. And we'd have to create List of World War I flying aces/Page top and List of World War I flying aces/Page bottom (easily done).

      "Good article overall, but in reading through it I think that certain areas are in need of improvement. Firstly I thought there wasn't really enough explanation of why it would be preferable to build a Space elevator. The economics section has info on costs and all, but this is rather brief and comes towards the end of the article, I would think that explaining the perceived necessity of such a device would be one of the first things to state.\n",
      "There were some things about the specifics of the engineering which I think need a lot more explaining, for one, is it proposed that the cable be a single thick wire or many tiny thin ones? It seems to be talked about at various points as if it could be either, so I think that needs more clarity.\n",
      "Something quite important that I don't think was addressed at all (or at-least I couldn't see it) was the issue of how exactly the cable (or the whole structure) actually gets up into space in the first place. Are we to assume that the cable will be towed up by a rocket or something? If not that, then how?\n",
      "Several times in the article it is mentioned that the \"\"Counterweight\"\", could be an asteroid or a space station. But these two things are very different aren't they? I mean in terms of mass, an asteroid probably weighs millions if not billions of tons, whereas a manmade space stations would be only a few hundred or thousand tons (unless some gargantuan station is proposed). So how can these to things be comparable? And what kind of actual weights will be involved?\n",

      "1) Via documented corruption and fraud, certain Wikipedia editors and administrators, notably Blackpearl14 and Lessheard vanU have openly accused, I,  Royce Mathew of “harassment”, “attacking”  “stalking” and such.   Utilizing their unique power, tools and resources provided by Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation Inc., they blatantly sought out and continue to seek out to threaten, hurt and damage contributing writers.   These are serious allegations.  However their corruption is not limited to themselves.   Other editors and administrators are part of their network, who works with them in their purposely threatening and deliberate destructive operation.  Wikipedia’s computer history has documented their actions.  Photos are available.  However, I firmly advise Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation Inc., to also preserve all of the evidence in light of possible litigation.\n",
      " \n",
      "2) On or about September 2, 2008, Blackpearl14 ,who had already gone through various identity changes as allowed by Wikipedia, who is afforded certain power, tools and resources by Wikinews,  Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation, has deliberately and deceitfully edited my complaint letter posted on the Wikipedia’s administrators “talk” complaint board.  She even cut out an entire paragraph from it.  This was done without my knowledge, nor with my permission and is completely unacceptable.  As electronic history recorded it, this was done to remove reported transcript evidence of her own self confessed bias, her own personal agenda, her own particular goals and her own self business associated with Wikipedia directly exploiting Wikipedia, it’s articles and the power provided to her.   She also had made changes to her own personal bio pages after I sent her a copy of the letter, acting as if the transcript sources didn’t exist.  After doing these corrupt acts, Blackpearl14 continued right on with her serious allegations against me.   She had responded directly below the adulterated letter.   Thus with her fraudulent and evident criminal acts, Blackpearl14  had corruptly altered and modified a letter to be deliberately representative of me, falsely presented it as being from me, and then herself and some of her fellow editors and administrators answered the letter as though they had only just read it.   Using the tools, resources, and privileged authority, Blackpearl14 continues to succeed in leveling serious charges against me, even falsely accusing me of modifying her bio, adulterating my talk correspondence which sought intervention, and meanwhile her peers of editors and administrators, had aided her acts.  To prevent any “undo” of Blackpearl14 deliberate adulteration of my letter, I was also blocked and any attempt to post a copy of the letter to yet again notify the administration of the serious issues at hand, were immediately deleted by Slakr.  They are a wild gang with free total control, provided by Wikinews,  Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation, with which to recklessly cause harm and destruction, and wrongfully threaten and silence their victims.   Wikipedia’s computer history has documented hers, her peers, editors and administrators continual acts.   Photos are available.  However, I firmly advise Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation Inc.,  to also preserve all of the evidence in light of possible litigation.\n",

For quick review, here is a collection of some of BLACKPEARL14 (uses various alias wikipedia names) self published bia quotes from 2007-through August 2008, on her own pages, as history recorded it, done by her, which she has clearly stated her bias purpose, her own bias causes and her own bias business.   “I am Pirate Lord-ess of the Caribbean Sea\n",

If we got rid of the notability requirement and just allowed all verifiable content to stay here, then it would create a much more objective system and we wouldn't have all these problems.

      "Anti-Serb sentiment is an umbrella term or generalization, obviously it will be poorly sourced just as List of Massacres in the Kosovo war is a WP creation. We find a subject then we link sources/stories to it but many articles do not represent a real world phenomenon. The fact is that Serbophobia as a concept is not a \"\"myth\"\" but it is confined to the nation's sympathizers and is rejected by the nation's detractors. Obviously Serbophobia is more degrading and more emphatic than \"\"anti-Serb sentiment\"\" in that implies an outright hatred. Naturally no Serb can truly accept no nation recognizing their declared states in Croatia (Krajina) and Eatern Bosnia during the Yugoslav Wars, seeing a West-brokered peace deal in 1994 putting at end to Bosniak-Croat hostilities then all uniting for a joint attack to end the Serb rebel states alongside world powers and claiming that the unlawful grounds for existence of those states was that they were not AVNOJ entities - and then a few years later support the UCK in Kosovo, pushing from the first moment to have FRY forces expelled, succeeding after airstrikes then nine years later recognize Kosovo - no AVNOJ argument there. But it doesn't end there, Kosovo achieved widespread positive feedback from US recognition to \"\"welcoming of independence\"\" from organizations such as the Basque authority in Spain - all entitled to their own opinions, but Serbs who claim Serbophobia are neither stupid nor blind to world events. You don't get the same positive and warm reception let alone recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia nor many other would-be states to exist or to have existed before being retaken by an aggressor (in the eyes of locals). These feats give Serbs to feel they are victims of international protectionism and that alone is enough to prove the sentiment. You're not going to convince them with fairy stories about how their heavy-handed 1990s oppression or disproportionate number of atrocities that time influenced on what side nations would eventually fall. That said, Savich and Trifkovic are fine sources, people just don't like them because their ethnicity so-called \"\"overrules\"\" their wisdom.   \"\n",

In any case, I found this source through a Roman Catholic, and it has an imprimatur from that church.  I've found other scholarly reviews for it as well, including a peer review from the Society of Biblical Literature.  Although I'm sure yours was a good faith edit and a simple mistake, I'm a bit concerned that you didn't ask me about it.\n",

Although we do need to have sources cleaned up here, we'd actually get along faster if you slow down a bit and discuss the sources with the editors who have provided them.

      "First off let's be clear, this is a proposed merger not a deletion. Looking at your argument of other stuff exists, the only HD specific example that you have mentioned (List of DirecTV local channels with HD) compares the availability of affiliated HD channels between cities, not a million miles away from this page comparing channel availability between platforms. The other examples that you have given are lists per platform, as you said. The fact is HD channels on Sky do form a part of Sky Digital and not another platform called Sky+ HD, HD channels are clearly labelled on List of channels on Sky Digital as being in HD were applicable. There is absolutely no distinction in the amount of HD content shown, if it simulcasts with an SD channel etc. on the same channel between platforms. There is no need for a list of channels in a certain broadcast format on a certain platform and it seems like content forking and listcruft. You also mentioned size, labelling this page as potentially \"\"unwieldy\"\", there are clear guidelines for the size of articles and compared to the other lists that you mentioned, this page could double in size without problems. If you want to talk long term, then in the future it's likely that being in HD or knowing if a channel uses up-scaling won't be especially notable just as being in 16:9 or using widescreen switching or stretching/zooming isn't today and at some point this page could also end up being merged or otherwise. By the way, there is a List of television stations in the United Kingdom (foreign versions may be found at Lists of television channels) and I agree that it is somewhat impractical for certain tasks. As for Andrewcrawford's actions, Help:Merging explains that \"\"If you think merging something improves the encyclopaedia, you can be bold and perform the merger, as described below. Because of this, it makes little sense to object to a merger purely on procedural grounds, e.g. \"\"you cannot do that without discussion\"\" is not a good argument. If the merger is controversial, however, you may find your merger reverted, and as with all other edits, edit wars should be avoided. If you are uncertain of the merger's appropriateness, or believe it might be controversial, or your merger ends up reverted, you can propose it on either or both of the affected pages.\"\" A proposal had been made in August 2008. \"\"If there is clear agreement with the proposal by consensus, or if there is silence, proceed with the merger.\"\" There was silence so he did nothing wrong. With regards to DarkLight748, he did not post any kind of edit summary with his edit, since Andrew does not a appear to be a regular contributor to List of HD channels on Sky+ HD he could have perceived that as vandalism and vice versa. -   \"\n",

Apparantly, according to an inside source (God, duh) one day back in 600,000,000,000,000,00 BC one of our ancestors mated with a wallaby and now all humans have this one wallaby gene which allows us to benefit from the new, pound shedding weightloss supplement. If you our any member of your family needs to loose weight just use the wallaby gene idiot. Problem solved. No more questions in life, just relaxation and collecting the money as it comes puring in.

      "\n",
      "1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. \"\"Nazi\"\" means \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party.\"\" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist.\"\"\n",
      "http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their \"\"Nationalist\"\" and \"\"New Nation\"\" magazines, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association\"\" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their \"\"Nationalism\"\" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book \"\"Looking Backward\"\" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  \n",
      "\n",
      "After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, and he preached what he called \"\"military socialism.\"\"  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the \"\"Wholecaust\"\" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'\n",

They have no nuclear arsenal, and according to their own constitution they're not allowed to use their military for anything other than defending their own country.

      " Might I ask what you mean by not REAL? Are you talking about the fact that he is NOT a King of a country? And that he is IN FACT the DE FACTO King of the Blasket Islands? The son of the first unofficially recognized titular monarch of the Blaskets since the \"\"great departure (when the indigenous inhabitants left the islands)?\"\" King Richard is just a King as the former King of Greece or just as Royal as the Princes of Russia or Germany. His Majesty DID NOT say that illegitimate German Nobility inherited titles. He simply said that Prince Albert's new title of Count de Grimaldi would be inherited to his descendents just as the titles of the former Royal and Noble German States; equal inheritance, which means (in case you did not know) that ALL children of a Count would gain the style of Count or Countess. That's all His Majesty was saying; NOTHING more. Everything else you said was pure \"\"make-believe\"\" (on your part). When we look at articles of FORMER Royalty or Nobility, or their descendents, such as you say are nt \"\"real,\"\" do we not see their \"\"not real\"\" titles listed as their titles? I see no difference with Countess Jazmin Grace Grimaldi de Grimaldi.

The Telegraph was a part of the Hollinger International chain of newspapers, whose board of directors happened to include one Richard Perle  a known American conservative and supporter of the Israeli right-wing. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs is likewise a think tank and reliquary for Israeli right-wingers (retired military and diplomatic staff especially) and funded by convicted felon Michael Milken. It is not hard to see that a right-wing ideologue Weiner did a hit-piece on Edward Said using funds from a right-wing think tank, published it in a right wing journal (Commentary), that was picked up by a sympathetic newspaper (the Daily Telegraph).\n",

      "\n",
      "Crunch (AGT Crunch Acquisition, LLC) is a fitness-based enterprise that is focused on making entertainment an integral part of the exercise experience. Established in New York in 1989, today the Crunch brand has 27 locations in 7 major urban centers in the United States: New York City, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a strategy, Crunch has concentrated on expanding inside of these urban centers: its penchant for innovation resonating especially well with the various demographics therein.  Because of these factors the brand is often associated with descriptors such as “hip”, “edgy”, “urban” etc. and has an air of inherent coolness that the majority of its competitors cannot claim to.\n",
      "\n",
      "FEATURES:\n",
      "\n",
      "1)TABGROUP FITNESS CLASSES\n",
      "Since its inception Crunch has maintained a focus on its group fitness program as the brand’s cornerstone. As such, it has built an extensive catalogue of classes that are characterized by their broad appeal and inventiveness. Numbering in the hundreds, these classes are organized into three different categories: Action Sports, Chill Outs and Dance Rhythms. Examples (taken from the official Crunch website) include:\n",
      "Urbanathlete (Action Sports)\n",
      "This circuit-style class is based on Men’s Health Magazine’s Fitness Challenge.  In it you’ll work through obstacles and exercises that were inspired by various cityscapes and come to see just about any sprawling metropolis as a big, concrete playground. \n",
      "\n",
      "Antigravity Yoga ‘Wings’ (Chill Outs)\n",
      "Wings’ will have you stretching further and holding challenging poses longer, using only a fabric trapeze to do so.  And, by employing simple suspension techniques you’ll move into poses that are seemingly impossible.  However, the goal isn’t just to turn you into a human pretzel: those poses will help to relieve compressed joints and align your body from head to toe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardio Dance Blast (Dance Rhythms)\n",
      "Get your groove on in this sixty-minute class that’s been cleverly disguised as a dance party – one with a soundtrack comprised of the best in hip-hop, reggae and top-forty music.  You’ll melt away fat while bringing your dance skills to the next level and beyond.\n",
      "In addition, Crunch offers private versions of their classes for small groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)TABPERSONAL TRAINING\n",
      "Each Crunch location has a staff of personal trainers available to its members for individual or semi-private sessions. Crunch divides these personal trainers into four different categories based on experience and certifications earned. (All of Crunch’s personal trainers are required to have a minimum of professional experience and certifications earned prior to being hired.) Collectively, these trainers have expertise in a broad range of areas. Quoting from the company’s press kit, “All Crunch clubs are staffed with first-rate fitness professionals – personal trainers with certifications in a wide variety of specialties: strength training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, pre/post natal, kettle bells, physical rehabilitation and much more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3) EQUIPMENT\n",
      "All Crunch locations feature a wide array of fitness equipment produced by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Precor, Life Fitness, Netpulse, Expresso, Icarian, Hammer Strength etc. This equipment is updated with an eye toward keeping current with emerging technologies and trends. For example Crunch is phasing in Life Fitness’ treadmills with built-in iPod functionality. Select Crunch locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles feature Pilates studios equipped with both Reformers and Wunda Chair Systems and locations in all markets feature Yoga studios. Additionally, certain facilities have more elaborate features: full-sized boxing rings, swimming pools, indoor tracks, basketball courts, saunas, hot tubs and sundecks.  \n",

      "Crunch health clubs are home to a unique fusion of entertainment and fitness, one that we have pioneered from our inception and continue to explore through a number of different channels. In-gym parties and performances (by students of Scratch DJ Academy), an outdoor summer concert series, partnerships with cutting-edge theatrical productions like Spiegelworld and Fuerzabruta and our Broadway Dance Series are all hallmarks of this exploration. Additionally, we’ve developed a number of events that take place outside of our gyms, like field trips (which are held year-round in all of our markets and vary greatly in destination) a\n",

      "The counterargument addresses the issue directly, and shows that \"\"Christ\"\" is used in the Book of Mormon in the same way that Biblical scholars have interpreted the term. They have translated the relatively synonymous terms 'Khristós' and 'Messiah' into English, giving each a distinct usage. Joseph Smith seems to have followed the same patterns in translation, because the purpose of a translation is to convey the meaning of the base language, not to be overly literal. Obviously, the word \"\"Khristós\"\" would not have been etched on the plates; the Nephites didn't speak Greek, just as they didn't speak French (see the end of the Book of Jacob). Joseph Smith chose to translate whichever word or character WAS written into the English word \"\"Christ,\"\" because that is how \"\"Christ\"\" is used in not only modern English, but in the English Bible itself. The fact remains that English Bibles use the terms \"\"Christ\"\" and \"\"Messiah\"\" in the same way that the Book of Mormon does, which the critics fail to mention (and they do not fault the Bible for doing so).\"\n",

Press releases are public domain with information and numbers verified by the state, desgined for public use (and in the case of much of the media, often copying verbatim). Simply put, there is no copyright when it comes to press releases issued by an office. The links are provided right underneath each section, not even consigned to the notes section. So what is the exact rule. The credit is fully given. Furthermore, your (and Thequackdaddy's) consistent monitoring of this page to remove postive elements but to protect under-referenced and biased negative content on this page has me very curious to who would spend so much energy doing so.

The more of that lost information that we can reconstruct, the more reliable our scientific hypotheses are likely to be.  ….  From the original complete assemblage of living organism, known as a ‘life assemblage” or biocenosis, many events occur that screen out certain organisms, leaving a much smaller death assemblage, or thanatocenosis.  The process of breakup and decay of organism immediately after death is known as necrolysis. \n",
      "\n",
      "“After a death assemblage accumulates, many other factors operate on the hard parts to break them up and scatter them around, so an even smaller percentage ends up buried for future fossilization.  These processes occur after necrolysis and are known as biostratinomy.  These agents of destruction can be biological, mechanical, or chemical.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biological agents are the most important factor in most environments, both marine and terrestrial.  Both predators and scavengers are very active in breaking up shells and bones ….  In summary, the key factor that prevents biological destruction is rapid burial.”\n",

      "For those organism that are not buried right away:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mechanical agents of destruction such as wind, waves, and currents can be very important.  These processes are most effective in shallow waters, where both waves and storm have their highest energies.  … In summary, the shape, density, and thickness of the bone or shell are the most important factors in determining survival under mechanical transport [until burial].”\n",
      "\n",
      "“After burial a variety of digenetic [chemical] changes in the rock can easily destroy shells.  … In summary, the original composition and the groundwater chemistry are the most important factors in determining whether digenetic changes are likely to alter or dissolve a fossil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Taphonomic research has come a long way since the pioneering studies of the 1960s and 1970s.  Paleontologists can no longer afford to naively take the fossil record at face value, but must always keep in mind the taphonomic “noise” that may obscure the original biological ‘signal’.”\n",

However, there are extraordinary fossil deposits around the world that preserve soft tissues and sometimes even skin texture and color patterns. … These are known as Lagerstatten (German for “mother lode”), and they have produced some of the most important fossils known.  … From all these examples, several general trends emerge.  The best fossilization occurs when there is rapid burial and anoxic conditions to prevent scavenging, no reworking currents and little or no digenetic alteration to destroy the fossils.”\n",

I have often heard Jack speak, pointing out that the dinosaurs of Montana were almost all killed and buried by catastrophic river floods near the shore of the inland sea that is now Eastern Montana, the Dakotas and related Canadian States.  The bones and the geology both acclaim to that.  Of course, these floods are considered local in extant.  This same theme is echoed on many signs and posters through out the museum.\n",

If I find that one or a few editors are 'ganging up' on me again (on the Techno music page), trying to silence information before the public reads it ie. a request for citation (Check in the View History this week for article), is there some channel on Wikipedia to report the incidents to 'higher ups'? Are there some editors who have some over-riding power? The incidents are on the Techno page. I've added that request tag for inline citations, and the guy keeps reverting my requests, for statements that have no citation. As per our previous discussion, I think the request for citation should be allowed to stand for 2 months, to give editors time to get their sources. I don't think there is anything wrong in asking for the source, but he keeps reverting my request. Also a european added some information, and these guys keep deleting it, because it's outside of 'Detroit'. Let me know if there are any channels to raise my case to.

Looks real to me and, if you watch Kellerman and Greer in the Zapruder film, which the US Government accepted as authentic, you can clearly see both of these individuals abandoning JFK. Kellerman was specifically assigned as his body guard and was required to shield JFK with his body. Johnson's SS agend did when the shooting started. Instead, Kellerman saw JFK was hit and then simply turned back around and sat there. Greer turned back TWICE as everyone in the limo was visibly in distress. His second turn sure looks unusual for someone who is trained to keep both hands on the wheel! To me it looks like the Adams / Newcomb / Cooper / Robertson observations are correct and the stabilized Zapruder showing Greer turning back to fire a pistol (low near his lap and NOT near Kellerman's forehead) is the evidence hiding in plain sight. Could the shooters have been blowing it and was Greer forced to finish the job?\n",

Perhaps the problem can be best summarized by your own comment on this page when you said that you thought about the issue and came to agree with the rest of the group. In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance, your actions were shameful. When faced with a group of people who reached consensus, you still had the audacity to have the page locked to reflect your (poorly reasoned) point of view. These are the actions of a stubborn child who wants his way and completely contradictory to what Wikipedia is about. I think you should grow up, recognize that your positions are often incorrect, and defer to the democratic process.

Today, those who are responsible for killings and lootings are sitting on the streets or get killed. Many Pashtuns have lost everything and live under the right of existence. The Mohammadzai were known to be wealthy and very rich and giving Afghanistan it´s ruling class with it´s royals, but today they do not differ from Kuchis and the drug-infected people of Kabul or Hazaras of Behsud or Tajiks of Kandahar.

And I think I found a connection north of Wellington on aerials at http://www.globexplorer.com/ , but I'm not sure - shouldn't be too hard to spot from the Commuter Rail (harder from the Orange Line because of the unused east track) if it exists. But even if there is an Orange-Green connection via Commuter Rail (and fairly direct at that, using the Grand Junction Line), I would very much doubt it gets any use.   \n",

Nearly all the C++ vendor implement in this fashion. Note also: The C++ deque cannot be implemented using an array. There is a requirement that references to elements in the middle of a deque remain valid if only the only thing done to the deque is add new elements at either end. An array implementation would fail when the array needs to be reallocated.\n",
