No matter what misinformation you may have read on the internet, SS anodes ARE INDEED consumed. During consumption highly toxic chromates are released into the electrolyte. Hexavalent chromium is extremely toxic and highly carcinogenic. Disposal of this electrolyte into the ground or down the drain is illegal and poses risks of contaminating ground water and city water supplies. Touching this chromate-containing electrolyte must also be avoided by all means.\n",

      " Same for teams=\n",
      " The races= field, which is generated in the Rallies line of the infobox  it's unclear what this is for perhaps change it to races-number= or even better, add an additional field rallies-number=, tell users in the doc that \"\"races\"\" is depreciated and \"\"rallies\"\" is preferred (because the output is \"\"Rallies\"\")\n",

The reason is that k varies very rapidly with T so that it is usually only convenient to study a small range of T, here 590-660 K. The true y-axis at x = 1/T = 0 corresponds to infinite T and is very far from the experimental range, or \"\"way off the graph\"\". If we insist on a graph which goes to x = 0, the measured points will cover only a small part of the graph which would make it hard to understand.

(My own brother, with a Bachelors in Science, called it 'whacked', though he could find no fault with its conclusions.) From what I can tell, it is a historical truth that scientists (being the busy people they are) detest new science models. Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets. For example, a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion, though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute. \n",

He includes an extract from a letter he sent to him in 1988 as Fred Franz neared death. He says he was not surprised he received no reply, but was sad, nonetheless. I'm intrigued, Fazil, about your comment, \"\"Later on his vitriolic sentiments/bias in his book suggests his dis-fellow-shipping was justified again and proves he is dishonest.\"\" Ray Franz was certainly critical of the WTS in his book, although \"\"vitriol\"\" seems too harsh a word. The overall tone of the book is concern and sadness, but if you have read the book you are free to make your own judgment. But what dishonesty are you referring to, and what is it in his book that \"\"proves\"\" he was dishonest? Willietell makes a claim based on local gossip that Franz lied about why he disassociated — though all the evidence points to Franz being right and Willietell being wrong — but I know of no other allegations that Franz was dishonest. Throughout his time in, and then out, of the organization, he was revered as a man of strong principle .... which, of course was the reason he decided he could no longer remain on the Governing Body or in the religion.   \"\n",

The reality is that free software just wants to survive in a hererogenous network based on open standards to ensure interoperability with everyone else; while Microsoft has a 90% share of desktops and is leveraging this to displace open standards in an attempt to kill free software. This strategy was outlined by a MS staffer years ago in the first of the Halloween documents.\n",

It is one of hundreds of companies that work in whole or in part in the Linux arena. None of the others benefit in any way from the agreement.

(2) XAML is itself a standards-buster, because it mimics W3C stuff (e.g. bits of CSS2) in an incompatible way.\n",

      "The fact that Azeris are mixed Turkic speaking people that sprung from the Turkish invasion points to the fact that they did not just appear.  They were and are in the location that was Arran that consistent of Albanians, and Iranian tribes.  Furthermore, the fact that the entire area was called Arran, then for some reason was renamed Azerbaijan is another indication that Azeris were not a Turkic speaking group that just living side by side in the Caucus next to the Sakas.  No one said Azeris in the north do not have differences when compared to other Iranians, in fact Iranians are a multi-ethnic, multi lingual group, much like the Kurds in the west have a different language/customs, as do Balochies in the south.  What happened to Iranians in Arran intermittingly, in which the Turks invaded their tribes, and the Albanians were driven out, and imposed their language on them via Elite Dominance, does not change their original ancestry.  You have again failed to give a single rationale as to where the Azeris came from, why they even appear/are part of Iran, even today, and why these ethnic groups even have a Persian culture?  In all, you can concentrate on their differences, but fail to explain where did Azeris come from?  It is astonishing how some choose to skip many important facts, and write pages of texts about Germanic peoples in an article about Iranian peoples.   I think I’ll stop at that.\n",

Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (\"\"Hakenkreuz\"\" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist.\"\" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol.

People constantly changing sourced text in articles because they have a view about ethnicity is very annoying, and the words are not ill-chosen they reflect the everyday facts of WP article on Balkans subjects. Every week I (and dozens of other editors) probably revert a dozen editors who have a particular view about what language code should be used in some article or another, and it's just POV nonsense. Your initial edit was just another example of carte blanche changes made without reference to the sourced material in the article. Now you have looked at it, you obviously have realised that the sources use Bosnian Muslims, not Bosniaks. This is the case with almost all scholarly texts on WW2 Yugoslavia. You can insist on whatever you like, but I certainly have no issue with identifying the commonly used modern ethnic affiliation of \"\"Bosniaks\"\" in the lead, just as I have no issue with identifying what the modern states are called.

      "\n",
      "Let's take a step back.  This article is the \"\"Ten Commandments\"\".  That is the verses in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 that are universally called the Ten Commandments; the ones that are debated about being placed in public school; the ones that are talked about as the fundamental of morality.  It is not about the list in Exodus 34.  The article is not about the use of the words \"\"עשרת הדברות\"\" in the Bible; it is about a particular Bible list that is called The Ten Commandments.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an important point, except that I would go further.  This article is not about a particular Bible list.  This is article about a cultural artifact known as \"\"the Ten Commandments\"\" that is strongly influenced by the Bible.  Sections of the Bible have been translated, moved around, edited, cropped, etc., and then declared \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\".  I think that many people think of the 10C as something where you just open the Bible up and there they are.  That's just not the case.  The cultural concept of \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\" is significantly extra-bibical.  Haven't you ever seen that Late Show bit where Letternman takes someone's words and edits them to say something different from what they actually said?  You can't just say \"\"well, I've quoted the Bible, so it's a legitimate representation of the Bible.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You feel that this statement is not sourced.  Yet I am sure you agree that the number \"\"Ten\"\" in the title \"\"The TEN Commandments\"\" comes from the Hebrew phrase \"\"aseret had'varim\"\" even if you personally think that this was a mistake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, I remain unconvinced of this.  I have seen no convincing evidence that the Bible using the word \"\"ten\"\" and people referring to the \"\"ten\"\" commandments are causally connected.  I certainly am willing to accede that this may say more about my knowledge of Bible research rather than about the 10C.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not think there is a better way of telling the reader that the etymology of the title \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\" for the list in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 is from the Hebrew \"\"aseret had'varim\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "So there are two problems immediately apparent here.  First, you have no cite for the claim that this is the etymology.  Secondly, even if it were the etymology, that would be an issue completely separate from whether the Bible actually says that.  After all, the etymology of the term \"\"Uncle Tom\"\" goes back to a book by Stowe, even though the Uncle Tom character is not in fact an \"\"Uncle Tom\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Any reasonable person reading the text as it now is would conclude that the Bible, in the Ex 20 and De 5 passages, uses the term \"\"עשרת הדברות\"\".  I don't see why you insist on retaining this misrepresentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a notable issue because, as you mentioned, the Ten Commandments are widely represented as being fundamental to Western Civilization.  Besides the numerous other problems with that claim, the fact that much of the importance given to \"\"The\"\" Ten Commandments is extrabiblical opposes that view.  \n",

The role of Campus Ambassadors will be to provide face-to-face training and support for students on Wikipedia-related skills (how to edit articles, how to add references, etc.). This includes doing in-class presentations, running workshops and labs, possibly holding office hours, and in general providing in-person mentorship for students.\n",

By vues I do not mean the apparent version of the fact given by YBM about the validity of the actual thesis. No. It isn't what it is about. It is more complex than that. It is about playing with people reactions in a situation of confrontations and playing with lies. Creating stories, ideas, like gossips who have no bund in the rality but who will nonetheless create a reaction in the people who are witnessing it at the time, and build on further from those reactions, and add more and more stuff to keep the tension and the artificial affair going on.\n",

      "\n",
      "In your correct information for the articles of your Wikipedia, you must read and analyze all the bibliographical data and to understand well the problems of a taxon or a group of let us taxa.  Thus, you can note that Rognes is the only amateur faunist (and not a recognized specialist), who wishes to make \"\" revolutions \"\" in taxonomy, without knowing Bengaliidae, without knowing the morphology of dipterous (in general), without being able to make a correct identification according to the male genitalia even of usual Calliphoridae.  In more he wanted to introduce an aberrant and specific terminology for his pupils of the school of handicappers of Stavanger (Norway) where he works, and was unaware of always the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.  All its \"\" research \"\" is not recognized by the community of the specialists.  Only his friends of the same structure, namely:  Thomas Pape (the recognized intellectual robber and the most stupid taxonomist nowadays), C Thompson, N.L. Evenhuis, J.E. O' Hara and (unfortunately) A. C. Pont wrote a bibliographical work, nonscientific, in which they mentioned exactly what I have says to you before on Rognes.  He cannot identify any species of Bengaliidae and he does not have competence to establish that Bengalia testacea  is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  This false type was mentioned before by Sabrosky in a stupid work of bibliography (nonscientific), in collaboration with the same ignoramuses collaborators (1999:62).  You must know exactly that of Zumpt until Lehrer, the species-type of the Bengalia kind is Bengalia labiata R.D. - not B testacea sensu Duponchel 1842 & Rognes, which is a nomen nudum. \n",

      "Umm - I'm not exactly \"\"promoting\"\" him.  I'm a Democrat, and I voted for Gore.  But the consensus of several users - in fact, EVERY user except you - was very clearly in favor of the quote being removed from the introduction.  The quote provides no context, is blatantly POV, not to mention terribly inaccurate and silly, considering what actually happened with the election fraud (see http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1104-36.htm) and the fact that Gore actually won anyway.  So how did he make Dubyah the president?  Yes, I'm aware that's the first thing many people think of when they see him, just as the first thing many people think of when they see Mama Cass is that she died choking on a ham sandwich.  This, like the quote, is not true at all, but merely an ill-researched fallacy.  Does this mean we should write in Cass' introduction that she is best known for having choked on a ham sandwich?  No, because it simply isn't factually based or accurate at all. Even if it was accurate, it still wouldn't be appropriate for the introduction as it provides no context. Pretend you are someone who didn't know anything about him, and you saw this quote that he \"\"made George W. Bush the president\"\"-what would that mean? Is he the magical fairy who goes around granting wishes and making people president with his magical fairy wand from Lollypopland? You need to provide context and a detailed account of what actually happened before you provide such a glib, not to mention factually inaccurate, summary. As I said before, I've reviewed Toes+umbrellas chacha's edits, and none of them appear to be vandalism, but a pretty good faith attempt at removing something which not only constitutes a huge violation of NPOV policy, but also violates the consensus as reached on this talk page months ago.  So again, I don't know what your point is about that user being banned, when the offense seems to be only the fact that they removed vandalism well over 3 times.  To me, your offenses of violation of NPOV, violating consensus when no one agrees with you, and editing other user's sigs seem a twinkle more extreme than theirs.  I invite everyone to look at the comments that Griot left on Astruc's talk page wherein he revealed his very clear bias on this issue-he accused Nader of being a \"\"Maoist\"\"-and he is clearly just using Wikipedia as his own personal coloring book to slander him in violation of NPOV policy, and in violation of an irrefutable consensus on this issue.   \"\n",

Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday.

      "\n",
      "Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. \"\"The Ten-String Guitar\"\" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact \"\"worthless\"\" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' \"\"short hands\"\" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not \"\"frequently\"\" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as \"\"crutches\"\" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!\n",

The page also only discussed radical feminism in relation to separatist movements, which is only displaying the most extreme part of radical feminist ideology while ignoring anything else that the movement may have to say.

      "Regarding the writer at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html and referenced at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute please note the following:  Mr. Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page- as Dr. Curry attempted to correct the many errors). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is \"\"covered up\"\" by people, and those people also often refer to it as the \"\"Nazi-Soviet\"\" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\" (they did not refer to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as \"\"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!\"\"  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word \"\"Nazi\"\" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the “Nazi-Soviet pact” page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase \"\"National Socialist.\"\" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made by Professor Curry. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment \"\"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!\"\"   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name \"\"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\"\" and also uses the term \"\"Communist\"\" instead of using the term \"\"Socialist.\"\"  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether salutes dictate particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired \"\"Nationalism\"\" clubs worldwide including in Germany. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Yes, the \"\"Roman salute\"\" page did once contain inaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to blabber with his use of the term \"\"conspiracy.\"\" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.   The John Seigenthaler story from Brian Chase is another notorious example of Wikipedia’s untrustworthiness.  On Wikipedia, the intellectually dishonest administrators block people who tell the truth, so it is specious to say that truth-tellers simply need to correct the articles.  \n",
      "\n",
      "    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who \"\"became wiser\"\", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledg\n",

As Wikipedia's own article on dehydration and the article on human urine notes, drinking urine, like drinking saltwater, does nothing at best, and increases the rate of dehydration at worst.  Normal urine contains about 95% water and 5% dissolved solids, much of which is salts.  The more dehydrated you are, the higher the percentage of salt in the urine.  Your body is only about 1% salt.  Water follows a diffusion gradient, so water *leaves* your cells to dilute the urine.  The kidneys can pump ions out of your blood to try and lower the salt concentration, but not *that* effectively.  Just like drinking seawater to survive is stupid and nearly universally recommended against, you shouldn't survive on urine, either.  And here, we're just talking about the salt, let alone the ammonia, nitrates, aldehydes, and other toxins that your body is trying to get rid of.

Thus the ambit of this culture is precisely in the region which we have identified on literary grounds as that of 'Arbana' and 'Albeigne'. The conclusion seems to be clear that the people of this region - known no doubt as Arbanoi and Albanoi - developed in this mountainous terrain, with many peaks of five and six thousand feet, a culture of their own which was distinct from those of the Serbian state in Zeta to the north, the First Bulgarian Empire in the lakeland area, and the Byzantine province of Epirus Nova.\"\" and you know that he says that Albanoi and Arbanoi are the current Albanians.  \"\n",

Egypt clearly wanted to seek the destruction of Israel as it did during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Had Egypt not made these hostile moves, Israel would have no reason to strike. Israel is a small country and when its enemies make hostile moves that may endanger its safety, Israel must move quickly. On a further note, no Egyptian ruler has ever offered peace towards Israel. Israel has always offered peace to Egypt. As a matter of fact, in 1979 Israel gave up the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for peace with Egypt.\n",

People like me stand on my own two feet, stand up to scrutiny, stand up to debate and discussion, stand up to a weight of opinion against me and stand behind my name and only my name each time I weigh in with my opinion. It is my belief that many others however employ sockpuppets to corroborate and support their point of view which in my view is a very cowardly and dishonourable method of \"\"argeing\"\" one's point. This is the reason why you can edit against consensus, because if there was a stipulation against it, the victim of the stipulation would employ the use of sockpuppets.

      "This was an operation done with full knowledge of top levels of the USG Intelligence Community who monitored it. Several former Soviet-bloc physicists were brought in as consultants including Dr. Valdimir Poponin, allegedly a personal acquaintance of Gorbachev's. We were interested in evaluating the controversial claims of \"\"Russian torsion field weapons\"\" and, therefore brought Gennady Shipov over from Moscow several times. On one trip Shipov lived with Sarfatti for about 2 weeks. Richard Hammond, and American physicist from Fargo working on torsion fields for US Navy at one time was brought in as well as R. Kiehn a former scientist for US SAC and retired professor from University of Houston.  Shipov worked with Akimov in Moscow who allegedly had strong military connections in the Soviet era. Sarfatti was the senior theorist on the American side of the ISSO core staff that included Saul-Paul Sirag. He arranged for Creon Levit to be borrowed from NASA AMES to run the daily operations of the project. Over a million dollars was given to SARA, a TRW spinoff DOD contractor in Huntington, Beach CA to further test a system developed by Jim Corum. Corum also wrote papers on \"\"The Philadelphia Experiment\"\" and had entre to the Tesla Archive in Beograd even during the Cold War. This was unusual. Corum later went to ISR in W.Va, a think tank doing exotic work with USG funds provided by Senator Robert Byrd and his Congressional counter-part in his home district. The key objective, of course, was to try to figure out how the \"\"saucers\"\" really flew. All of the key scientists had interest in that, with the possible exception of Hammond and Kiehn. Harold Puthoff was brought in as a consultant. Ken Shoulders was also involved as were many others whose schemes were tested. The key foreign figure was Professor J. P. Vigier from Paris who had been Louis DeBroglie's assistant for decades. Sarfatti arranged for a Telegraph Hill Penthouse for Vigier to spend extended periods meeting the scientists flowing through ISSO. Vigier and Levit made a trip to Budapest in 2000 to meet with two Serbian physicists  Z.Maric  & A. Dragic who were experimentally testing an exotic atomic energy release idea of Vigier's of obvious interest to USG Intelligence because of its WMD implications. See the paper \"\"On the possible Existence of Tight Bound States in Quantum Mechanics\"\". pp 349-356 of the same volume of one of Sarfatti's papers, i.e. Vol 126 of Fundamental Theories of Physics, ISBN 1-4020-0885-6. This is not a coincidence. There are few coincidences in \"\"this Looking Glass War Twilight Zone interface between physics and politics\"\" to quote Sarfatti in one of his more eloquent moments. ;-) In fact, ISSO paid most of the expenses for the meeting upon which the volume is based. Enuff said. I hope this helps to somewhat clarify Sarfatti's multiple roles in these events. Sarfatt is a kind of a canary in the mind shaft for MASINT. For example, he was quite alarmed about an immanent attack on important US Military targets in the Fall of 2001. Sarfatti wrote numerous e-mails on this during July & Aug 2001. It seems to be a case of precognitive remote viewing. Unfortunately, Sarfatti was not able to pinpoint the exact time and place of the attack (attacks). He had guessed Oct 2001 because of some big anti-space weapons rally by leftist groups scheduled for that time at Lockheed-Martin. [User:UFO_Black_Ops]]  Oct 16, 2005\"\n",

      "Actually, there is a subtle point that this article gets wrong, and in fact many books get wrong (or fail to emphasize, although I believe it's because everyone learns it this way). Yes, I know that if it is wrong, I could just update it myself; but it looks like this will require a bit of rearrangement which I'm not quite in the mood to sort out now, and so it is best for me to give a brief statement of the issue here. It's also way past my bedtime, so, if anyone wants to help out while I'm sleeping, be my guest.\n",

      "The problem is a terminological confusion which arises from using the term pullback for different (but related) things. For f  M → N a smooth map, there is usually not a smooth bundle map from T*N to T*M (unless f is a diffeomorphism). There is a pointwise map of individual cotangent spaces f*p  Tf(p) N → Tp M for every p, defined by operation with the pushforward of a vector in the corresponding tangent space (it is the transpose of the pushfoward on individual tangent spaces). But for the general point q in N we can't pull back to M unless we have a way of choosing a point in f-1(q) (which is especially problematic if f is not onto...). However, we can pull back sections of the cotangent bundle (i.e. covector field, and this applies in general to covariant tensor fields). The \"\"pullback\"\" everyone talks about is a map from covector fields on N to covector fields on M, that is, given ω: N → T*N a section, we define f*ω  M → T*M  by\n",
      "\n",
      "where f*p is just the pointwise pullback defined before. This is always well-defined. Note that this is just the opposite of the problem with vectors and their fields (and in general, contravariant tensor fields): in that case, there is a pushforward which is a smooth bundle map of the tangent bundles, but in general vector field does not push forward unless the map is a diffeomorphism. It has been remarked in several books that the co-objects seem to have this wonderful extra structure, of being able to pull back sections. What really happened is that it gave up the capability to induce a smooth bundle map of the bundles in the process, thus restoring one aspect of \"\"duality\"\" that seems to have been broken when dealing with this subject.\"\n",

      "I have not yet seen Tim's paper, I assume that it demonstrates that lithium is not an *essential* nutrient by its absence. That doesn't kick it out of OMM. The claim seems that lithium and orotate ions are naturally occurring, utilizable substances in the diet and orthomolecular substances packaged in a salt, similar to common synthetic vitamins, e.g. thiamine nitrate, vs the natural cocarboxylase (pyrophosphate). OMM is not so synthetic friendly to the alien enantiomers in synthetic oil solubles.  However Lithium is most certainly a naturally occuring item in the water of many places; growing up in one place whose water source contained Li this was something of a joke about why people were so mellow. This will come up about others like strontium which are reputed to be good for the bones too, the natural versions considered OMM. Then there is strontium ranelate, a xenobiotic because of the artificial anion.  OMM's relation to pharmacological herbs seems ambivalent for several reasons.  One, probably, is that the largest body adopting the most (adapting from) OMM are probably the naturopaths, so if it is in the approved garden, why sweat it?  Honestly though, there is the question, how do we define xenobiotic and not xenobiotic in OMM? I don't have a fast answer myself between applying Pauling's definition and the definite feeling that some plant extracts are not OMM but xenobiotics.  One can probably develop a Socratic argument starting with hemlock... As for the St John's Wort, the plant contains things that are definitely nutrients. The extract is a homework assignment. This is one of the gray areas where *my impression* is that one may traverse from the orthomolecular field to the herbal part of naturopathy without necessarily encountering a clear boundary. (Sort of like the pressurized, critical path skirting, water heating experiment with no clear phase change between liquid and steam and back) One other comment is that it is \"\"okay\"\" if something is not OMM, OMM does not claim to be the \"\"be all, end all\"\" answer, or a jealous god, er, guild. OMM MDs do apply conventional drugs and surgery more sparingly, they probably just don't get as many \"\"free\"\" boat trips (but the Glacier cruise is nice).  \"\n",

Despite 's statement, you have not so far been reported at WP:Administrator intervention against vandalism as far as I can see; but if you continue your disruptive editing you will be. Looking at your edits, I get that you have strong opinions about John de Ruiter. While I know nothing of him, I have some sympathy with your position. But you are going about your campaign in a way that is disruptive to Wikipedia, and you need to stop.\n",
      "First, as you have already been told, you introduced material (and, in particular, critical material) into a biography of a living person without giving any references to a published source which supports your material. This is absolutely forbidden, but the first time you did it our policy of assuming good faith should lead any other editor to just remove your additions and explain to you that this is not acceptable; and this is what happened.\n",
      "What you are encouraged to do at that point, is to discuss the matter on the talk page Talk:John de Ruiter, and try to reach agreement with other editors; if you are unable to do so, our dispute resolution procedure would tell you how to proceed.\n",
      "What you did do, is to insert your unsupported material again. This is called edit warring, and is a quick way to get yourself blocked from Wikipedia.\n",

      "Assuming that you are in good faith (i.e. that you think the de Ruiter article is unbalanced), your best bet is to start by finding some reliable published sources which are critical of him (not blogs or forums, but material from reputable publishers). If you can find some, then you may edit the article to add only what is supported by the sources you have found (though in view of your recent history, even in this case you should probably start by discussing it on the talk page). If you cannot find such sources, then I'm afraid you must not edit the page further. Unsupported material and original research are not permitted in Wikipedia articles.\n",

This feels like AfD being used as a vehicle for doling out punishment for unconstructive editing behaviors, which is what blocks are for, not AfD.   drop me a line (note: not a bot!) \"\n",

Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.\n",

      "First, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.)\n",
      "Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  \"\"No-boo\"\" may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.\n",
      "If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called \"\"The No-boo Affair\"\", then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is \"\"the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did\"\", it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a \"\"clear falsification\"\", but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term \"\"no-boo\"\" becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted.\n",
      "Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this \"\"No-boo Affair\"\" is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.\n",

The few free energy machines still having their own wikipedia page are full of rant how crackpots try to destroy the laws of thermodynamics and how nutterish they are, not your usual trolling but the work of experts. Take the introduction of the Water fuel cell. \"\"the source of this addition energy has not been scientifically identified therefore the theory is treated with skepticism.\"\" There was barely any theory, it just worked! And it has not been investigated. The way it's treated is not worthy of being in the description. An encyclopedia should not instruct it's readers behaviour? Tell me how to treat things huh? \"\"such a practice conforms to the parameters of perpetual motion, hence conclusive scientific investigation would either verify violation of thermodynamic law or identify the source of claimed additional energy.\"\" But if there isn't going to be any scientific analysis - ever! then the laws of thermodynamics are nonsense. If the best scientists can do is preach the laws then it's just not very likely they are right about the topic. Then it says: \"\"At least one car prototype, reportedly powered by a water fuel cell, has been assembled.\"\" HUH what? but but but??

An Ohio court found Stanley Meyer guilty of fraud in a case brought against him by disgruntled investors.\"\" So he was scammed by his own investors. What kind of person would do that with a known to work invention? And why was this important information deleted? Then it says: Stanley Meyer was granted patents in the United States and abroad starting in 1989. The verifiability, and scientific basis, of the patents are controversial. Now I know the water motor patents where granted after a working model was displayed. You can see it in the application number. There is no other way to get a patent on an electrolysis cell. Because of those laws of thermodynamics you know? You do know about those right? You can see free energy suppression live at work when you see that the world famous American inventor Stanley Meyer was not worthy of his own wikipedia page. It's obvious he cant have a page because that would violate conservation of energy right? Paul Pantone does have his own page where again the working of his device is denied by no-witness, The GEET page however describes a Hindi film? BTW Paul was also scammed by his investors? ha-ha?

      "But the Croats at that time were dwelling beyond Bavaria, where the Belocroats are now. From them split off a family of five brothers, Kloukas and Lobelos and Kosentzis and Mouchlo and Chrobatos, and two sisters, Touga and Bouga, who came with their folk to Dalmatia and found the Avars in possession of that land. After they had fought one another for some vears, the Croats prevailed and killed some of the Avars and the remainder they compelled to be subject to them. And so from that time this land was possessed by the Croats, and there are still in Croatia some who are of Avar descent and are recognized as Avars. The rest of the Croats stayed over against Francia, and are now called Belocroats, that is, white Croats, and have their own prince ; they are subject to Otto, the great king of Francia, or Saxony, and are unbaptized, and intermarry and are friendly with the Turks. From the Croats who came to Dalmatia a part split off and possessed themselves of Illyricum and Pannonia ; they too had a sovereign prince, who used to maintain friendly contact, though through envoys only, with the prince of Croatia. For a number of years the Croats of Dalmatia also were subject to the Franks, as they had formerly been in their own country ; but the Franks treated them with such brutality that they used to murder Croat infants at the breast and cast them to the dogs. The Croats, unable to endure such treatment from the Franks, revolted from them, and slew those of them whom they had for princes. On this, a large army from Francia marched against them, and after they had fought one another for seven years, at last the Croats managed to prevail and destroyed all the Franks with their leader, who was called Kotzilis. From that time they remained independent and autonomous,....\n",
      "..................\n",
      "These baptized Croats will not fight foreign countries outside the borders of their own ; for they received a kind of oracular response and promise from the pope of Rome who in the time of Heraclius, emperor of the Romans, sent priests and baptized them. For after their baptism the Croats made a covenant, confirmed with their own hands and by oaths sure and binding in the name of St. Peter the apostle, that never would they go upon a foreign country and make war on it, but rather would live at peace with all who were willing to do so ; and they received from the same pope of Rome a benediction to this effect, that if any of the pagans should come against the country of these same Croats and bring war upon it, then might the God of the Croats fight for the Croats and protect them, and Peter the disciple of Christ give them victories.\n",
      "...............\n",
      "Again, Symeon sent another army against prince Zacharias, under Kninos and Himnikos and Itzboklias, and together with them he sent also Tzeeslav. Then Zacharias took fright and fled to Croatia, and the Bulgarians sent a message to the 'zupans' that they should come to them and should receive Tzeeslav for their prince ; and, having tricked them by an oath and brought them out as far as the first village, they instantly bound them, and entered Serbia and took away with them the entire folk, both old and young, and carried them into Bulgaria, though a few escaped away and entered Croatia ; and the country was left deserted. Now, at that time these same Bulgarians under Alogobotour entered Croatia to make war, and there they were all slain by the Croats.\n",

'Serbs' in the tongue of the Romans is the word for 'slaves', whence the colloquial 'serbula' for menial shoes, and 'tzerboulianoi' for those who wear cheap, shoddy footgear. This name the Serbs acquired from their being slaves of the emperor of the Romans. Now, after some time these same Serbs decided to depart to their own homes, and the emperor sent them off. But when they had crossed the river Danube, they changed their minds and sent a request to the emperor Heraclius, through the military governor then governing Belgrade, that he would grant them other land to settle in. And since what is now Serbia and Pagania and the so-called country of the Zachlumi and Terbounia and the country of the Kanalites were under the dominion of the emperor of the Romans, and since these countries had been made desolate by the Avars (for they had expelle\n",

As for the allegations of Roed-Larsen, why do imagine that they were based on the IDF spokesman's claim, as opposed to the many claims of massacre from Palestinians weeks earlier.  On April 4, Secretary-General of the Palestinian Authority, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, complained in an interview on Palestinian television about “…world silence over the massacres being perpetrated against the Palestinian people.” (BBC Worldwide Monitoring). On April 6, Nabil Sha'ath delivered a speech at a meeting of the Arab League, in which he charged that “a 'massacre' was underway in the Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin.” (Deutsche Presse-Agentur) He also “compared Israeli actions in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus to the 1982 massacres of hundreds of Palestinans…” (The Associated Press). On April 7, Abdel Rahman told NBC’s Tim Russert, “The victims so far has been over 250 Palestinians killed, many of them are children and women.” Saeb Erekat is quoted by Washington Post as having said “This is not fighting between armies, but a massacre in Jenin camp.\"\"  Why do you think that the IDF spokesman's statements from over a week later were so influential, as opposed to these many public statements by Palestinian spokesmen which were widely disseminated in major news outlets?

      "BCS National Championship Game.  I tried a number of edits to properly represent the BCS' nullification of the participation of USC in two illegal Championship Games, and removing their designation, since the games no longer are believed to have taken place.  http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=6632189   An edit war began on that subject, and the subject of Wikipedia's rules regarding “no damnatio memoriae came up.  I proposed, and repeatedly, that the concept of damnatio memoriae applied, since that was the exact penalty imposed by the BCS when they nullified the entire participation of USC in the 2005 Orange Bowl and 2006 Rose Bowl (pages (along with USC's entire 2005 season, nullified by the NCAA beforehand) I would've deleted eight weeks ago under encyclopedic verification, but we now have a conflict between damnatio memoriae and encyclopedic verification).\n",
      "\n",
      "AND, since Wikipedia does not respect the BCS as a sanctioning body (trying to remain neutral – I'll get to that in a moment in part two!), Wikipedia accepts as valid USC's 14 vacated victories, including in a BCS National Championship Game which no longer logistically should exist.  Hence, Wikipedia  recognizes (in the form that they won the 2005 Orange Bowl) USC as the BCS National Champion – if Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and their participation in the 2006 Rose Bowl, which was also nullified by the BCS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ergo, we now have a non-encyclopedic, non-verifiable situation which is, in fact, false!  Only the sanctioning body can give sanction to the event, and only the sanctioning body can take it away.  (Remember this one for later, as well!)  I had respected the decision of “no damnatio memoriae, but can do so no longer, because of the fact that it creates an encyclopedic falsehood!\n",

      "Encyclopedic content must only be considered verified by the collective.  That is all, and also that is the only acceptable basis for content on Wikipedia – actual encyclopedic verification is no longer sufficient nor necessary.  Anything short of that will be removed by the collective.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I am reinstated, I am considering removal of all mentions of vacated participation in games.  That means the 2005 Orange and 2006 Rose Bowls go, as does their mentions in BCS National Championship Game, as well as USC's entire 2005 season page, replaced with notations of the nullifications.  Any other games where the participation of one or both schools are removed also go as well.  (As one example, the 2011 Sugar Bowl may also be deleted, if the NCAA or BCS nullifies specifically Ohio State's participation in the event.)\n",

      "\n",
      "I also changed \"\"quantity\"\" to \"\"quantity demanded\"\" for the sake of clarity and completeness. It's crucial that the definition be as precise as possible in emphasizing that PED is concerned only with changes in quantity demanded.  (Elasticity is one of the most difficult concepts in micro for most beginning students and for other potential readers/users  WP's \"\"customers\"\"; they tend to get confused by the slightest ambiguity about which quantity we mean.  An ounce of emphasis here doesn't preclude such confusion, but it can help avoid a pound of it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, I added \"\"services\"\" to the definition as a token reminder that PED, as well as the laws of supply and demand, apply to both goods and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only other noteworthy revision was to the beginning of the last sentence in the first paragraph to place more emphasis on the PED for the most typical types of goods and services.  Although the Giffen and Veblen exceptions are interesting, they are almost negligibly rare anomalies compared to the overwhelming number of typical goods and services governed by the Law of Demand.  (That's why it merits the rare status of a \"\"Law\"\"!)  The exceptions deserve discussion eventually (in a later section), but I think this introductory paragraph would be strengthened by giving them only the briefest possible mention in passing here.  Instead, this paragraph should focus attention on the crux of the issue that readers need to remember (the \"\"take-away\"\"), namely:  because the demand for most goods and services obeys the Law of Demand, their PED coefficients will always be negative.  \n",
      "\n",

Deviating would net an extra 1,000 for that round, but would cap the maximum payoff at 1,000 in the next round, where it would have been 1,000,000.

But that doesn't mean we should link both regions in the same basket. The navarrese government has never expressed any intention of reducing its own political or social identity, the same way Andorra, Balears or Valencia haven't either. Participating in a single cultural project such as the IRL, doesn't mean that suddenly those territories have renounced to their own identities (so close or so distanct to the Catalan proper). We are not even explaining that it is just a part of the population which may be considered as catalans...

      "Paid advocacy editing, on the other hand, can easily gain as many paid advocacy editors as desired by simply paying more. Think of the difference between getting emails advocating politics or religion vs. emails about online pharmacies. The first is annoying, but self limiting; the second gets bigger and bigger as long as it remains profitable. Our article on Email spam gives numbers like 200 billion spam messages sent per day and 97% of all emails being unwanted. I think Jimbo is right to be especially concerned over something that could grow exponentially.\n",
      "Second, we really cannot do anything to convince most religion or politics advocates to change their ways other than blocking or banning them, but we can make big changes in how paid advocacy editors operate. If it becomes well known that the advocacy editors who don't edit articles directly but instead make talk page requests get better results and that the sneaky kind of paid advocacy editor usually gets reverted, the customers will naturally go with the service that gets the best results. We can make that happen, but again it takes special care.\n",

      "Thank you for finally looking into this.  Do you think I would be so adamant if I had something to hide vis a vis the clone/impersonation issue?  I will be very curious to see what your findings show, as I have my suspicions, but I will keep them to myself for now.  As I have repeatedly stated, the *only* anonymous edits I made were after my editing privileges were blocked, and then only to correct misinformation in the Farmer article, all of which has since been re-inserted by Wyss herself.  You're right, all I wanted was accuracya simple review of my very first post to Wyss' talk page will show (despite my improper posting etiquette, for which I have repeatedly apologized) that all I asked her to do was fact-check.\n",

      "I am well aware of the Rashomon like qualities of attempting to discern the truth about Frances Farmer.  That indeed is why the subtitle to my article \"\"Shedding Light on Shadowland\"\" is indeed called The Truth About Frances Farmer.  That in turn is why my research has been used by A&E; Biography, NPR, the Washington Post, and, hilariously, the magazine Wyss apparently thinks discredits me, 'American Atheist.'  If you read Conrad Goeringer's article in 'American Atheist' you will find that I am his major source of information and, indeed, there is a whole secondary article about me and my findings vis a vis the false lobotomy allegations.\n",
      "\n",
      "What bothers me about all of this is not the block (though Wyss says it's easy to get rescinded, I have yet to receive even a hint of how to do that, but that truly is not important to me), but Wyss' repeated assertions that I have sinister motives and, more importantly, have cloned her ID and/or impersonated her.  In terms of my motives, I have for over 20 years worked diligently to rid the world of misinformation about Frances Farmer, and I have been lauded internationally in the press and broadcast media for my attempts.  How is that sinsister?  In terms of the cloning/impersonation, what more can I say?  I have asked repeatedly for someone to do something technical to prove I didn't do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems that Wyss has had frequent run-ins with others, and perhaps I am the unwitting recipient of some pent-up frustration on her part.  As I have come to surmise, I am probably at least twice as old as most of you, and I am willing to cut you \"\"kids\"\" (joke) some slack, but I want these false allegations to stop and I am asking again for someone to do an IP trace and consclusively state publicly to Wyss and everyone involved that I had nothing to do with this clone ID/impersonation affair.\"\n",

Editing policy only applies if (again) the content has encyclopedic value, which is exactly the point I'm disputing.  and last I checked (if this were a vote, which it isn't) the RfC was 9 to 6 in favor of removing, though some of the 6 in favor of keeping put a lot of effort into rationalizing that result away.\n",
      " Repeating myself yet again: you are not going to win this debate by quoting policy at me, because I can quote policy just as well as you can (possibly better).  you are not going to win this debate by using insulting terminology like 'scraping the bottom of the barrel'.  I know how to deal with pointless rhetorical snark, and it doesn't phase me in the least.  you are either going to have to give a reason explaining why this content is valuable - which would be the decent thing to do - or else you're all going to have to stick to the current practice of bullying and edit warring to keep the content in.  I'm happy to discuss the matter if you choose that route, I'm sanguine with (and capable of) refuting all of your policy misconstruals, and if you want to go the other path I'll see if I can get some other reasonable editors to come and help me remove it unreasonably.

      "The net effect is that you deleted a bunch of content, plus which there is more to say about each individual rate (construction particulars for instance), plus it doesn't work with the categorization system. When thinking about merging articles, one important thing to consider is whether the article is small because it's new and needs more content, or it will always be small. In the case of the RN rates, all have much to say about them - rationale, evolution, employment, plus a picture or two so we can see what they looked like. This article should be about the system as a whole (who introduced it and why? When did it go out of use? How did it compare to other nations' systems?) - once you have adequate treatment of all that, plus the two screenfuls with two representative pictures per rate, that's a pretty hefty article, no longer easy for reader to get the basic definition of \"\"third-rate\"\". When considering organization like this, it's worthwhile to look at history of all the articles concerned, and maybe query the editors who set it up, because what you've effectively done is to destroy article structure that I and others carefully set up some time ago. Talk pages are mostly used for debate, so lack of talk page bits combined with multiple editors in history indicates that all the editors agreed perfectly, no need to discuss.  08:01, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)\"\n",

      "Hello - I came across your query on the discussion page for the New Rochelle Post Office. If you want the correct information you cannot rely on what Orlady has told you. She is the sole individual objecting to the use of the term 'mural' when referring to the artwork that is in the building. The building is a NRHP however not so much for the architectural significance, but for the murals inside. Specific reference to the term 'mural' can be seen in a number of sources that were provided.  These sources include very reliable documents including: United States Post Offices in New York  1858 to 1943  Thematic Resources (the National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form), The Westchester County Planning Board discussing the post office in relation to re-developing the site,further discussions,  and the New York Times article about the artist selected to paint the murals. The nomination form is the most irrefutable source validating the information (it specifically references two of the three murals when discussing the importance of post office art). Additionally, the city of New Rochelle continues with redevelopment of the area and has recently come to the decision that the significance of the building itself is minimal, with its only true attribute being the 'distinctive curved contour' of the front facade which is familiar to residents of the area and should be maintained. (Im sorry but I cant find this specific document at the moment). The continuing reverting of this information is entirely the result of Orlady who personally does not seem to care for the facts. Unfortunately it is resulting in a deficient and inaccurate article. I also should mention that blocking users as alleged puppets of a banned user seems to be the most useful means for Orlady to control the content of certain articles. She is clearly abusing the tool. The validity of her claims is questionable at best. I was blocked as a result of my contributions to this article, and was labeled a 'sock'. Considering that I am in no way connected to the banned user, I found it rather disturbing to be blocked based on 'evidence' that has absolutely no validity whatsoever. Perhaps you can spend a moment to review the information provided and the facts will speak for themselves. Thank You\n",

In the 1930s the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, disenfranchised, and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups. 連絡 見学/迷惑 \"\n",

      "Hi, thanks for your thoughts. I have to disagree about your disambiguity-argument. You say \"\"Germany\"\" can refer to either \"\"West Germany\"\" or \"\"East Germany\"\". This is - as I already stated - simply not correct, since there never was a country named \"\"West Germany\"\" and there never was a country named \"\"East Germany\"\", they were called those names in foreign media for simplicity reasons, as the \"\"Federal Republic of Germany\"\" was part of the western capitalist world or first world, while the \"\"Peoples Republic of Germany\"\" was part of Eastern bloc, or second world. Still this is not the correct term for the country, and is therefore no phrasing for an encyclopaedia. It is colloquial language that saves time, but still this doesn't make it the correct term. I do not make up names or use other possibly derogatory terms for other countries, and therefore would prefer, if wikipaedia articles are kept in a neutral tone too. So if there is really confusion to avoid, then the only correct way to do so, is to use the complete names of the country, and not some popular slang. To be honest, i didn't think there would be a confusion, and someone might think this final was between the Peoples Republic of Germany and England, and not between the Federal Republic of Germany and England (since the Peoples Republic of Germany only participated in one World Cup anyways). But that's probably me knowing already a lot about this topic and forgetting about people that know little about World Cup history, so i might be wrong. But if others do think the distinction is necessary, then please distinguish the teams with the real names of the country and not colloquial language. Finally i want to point out, that the link to Germany National Footbal Team leads to an article that already explains, that there were temporary governing football associations other than the DFB, so if there really is a confusion which German team this is, a click on the link of the team name will resolve that confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your second argument is, that \"\"most sources refer to that team as West Germany\"\". That may be right, but is that really the deciding criterion? If i find, that most sources say, that eg Evolution is wrong, and Intelligent Design is right, will that decide the content of a wikipaedia article? I know it's a bad example, and i don't want to provoke a political or offtopic discussion, i just want to make to point that what many people say is not necessarily right. But unlike in discussions about \"\"most sources say Britney Spears is the best singer of all times\"\" this whole thing is not up to taste, political views, scientific surveys, or speculations. It is simply a fact, that the name of the country this team represents is not \"\"West Germany\"\", so it is not right to call the football team that represents this country \"\"West Germany\"\". If you don't believe that this is a fact, then look it up on every government document of the Federal Republic of Germany, the name \"\"West Germany\"\" is never used. And btw: it is not like, there is no source using the proper name of the team. It may not be the majority (i don't know tbh), but i am confident, that i can find a sizeable number of references using the correct term, which will be enough for every passage of this article. German sources use the correct term anyways, i could bombard you with thousands of sources in German language that use \"\"Germany\"\" or \"\"FRG\"\" or \"\"BRD\"\", and not \"\"West Germany\"\". At the end it is the souvereign right of a country to name herself (see also Macedonia vs Greece) and in English the \"\"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\"\" has the official name \"\"Federal Republic of Germany\"\" - or short \"\"Germany\"\" - and has never called herself or referred to itself as \"\"West Germany\"\", or \"\"Federal Republic of West Germany\"\" or any other alteration including geographical terms. And the governing body of German football since 1900, the \"\"Deutscher Fußballbund\"\" which translates into \"\"German Football Association\"\" has never called itself \"\"West German Football Association\"\" or referred to its players as \"\"West Germans\"\". As i have already mentioned above, all Germans were eligble to play, whether they are from east or west or south or north. Even Germans born in other countries are eligible, like Paolo Rink born in Brazil, or Miroslav Klose/Lukas Podolski/Piotr Trochowski born in Poland, or Oliver Neuville born in Switzerland, as long as they have German ancestry. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is and was the explicit objective of the DFB to represent all Germans.

      "I'm not sure one can draw exact parallels between \"\"mechanistic\"\" (non-subluxation based) and \"\"Vitalistic\"\" (subluxation-based) chiropractors, although it would generally be true. While some mechanistic chiros may choose to limit their practice, they can still be Vitalists. OTOH, Vitalism is an integral part of the belief in vertebral subluxations (VS). It all depends on how you choose to define Vitalism. In a general sense, all healthcare practitioners know that the body has inherent abilities to heal itself. This has never been unique to chiropractic and predates it. Vitalism in its religious/metaphysical sense also predates chiropractic and Palmer, but is the basis for Palmer's development of the concepts of Universal Intelligence (UI) and Innate Intelligence (II). I can conceive of some subluxation-based chiropractors not being conscious and informed believers in UI, IOW they are actually mechanistic subluxation-based chiros. (Even some professed atheists can believe in some sort of supernatural entity......;-)) They will tend to confuse VS for orthopedic subluxations, considering them to be the same. Truly informed and practicing Vitalistic subluxation-based chiros (the Planet chiro and F.A.C.E. type) are normally members of the ICA or WCA, and understand the difference, and that is that VS has a metaphysical element that is the unique property of chiropractic. Without this principle difference, chiropractic loses its uniqueness. When it comes down to it, belief in VS is the most fundamental difference between chiropractors, and influences many other things about the way they think and practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is something about chiropractic and Vitalism:\n",
      "\n",
      "The debate over whether life is controlled by spiritual or material forces peaked in the nineteenth century. By this time, scientists endorsing \"\"spiritual\"\" control began to refer to themselves as \"\"vitalists.\"\" Vitalism, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, is the doctrine that the processes of life are not explainable by the laws of physics and chemistry alone and that life is in some part self-determining. Vitalists contended that some vital factor, as distinct from physiochemical factors, was involved with \"\"controlling\"\" the body's structure and function. Since the definition of vitalism emphasizes that its character is beyond the laws of physics (measurement), vitalistic mechanisms were outside of the defined parameters of modern science. In spite of its metaphysical nature, vitalism was still endorsed by many traditional nineteenth century scientists. \n",
      "\n",
      "The support for vitalism was soundly shaken in 1859 when Charles Darwin published his Origin of Species. In his treatise on evolution theory, Darwin emphasized that internalized \"\"hereditary factors\"\" (the existence of genes had not yet been recognized) were responsible for controlling the character of evolving species. Within a decade of its presentation, Darwinian theory was endorsed by the majority of conventional scientists. Darwin's theory of evolution denied the role of spirit or life force in the unfoldment of life on this planet. Consequently, scientists myopically focused on the search for the internalized material elements that \"\"controlled\"\" biological organisms. \n",
      "\n",
      "D. D. Palmer was very sensitive to scientists' displeasure concerning concepts related to spirit and vital forces. In formulating the original science of Chiropractic, he coined the terms Universal Intelligence and Innate Intelligence to refer to the inherent organizing intelligence of the Universe and of life. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"In the early years of Chiropractic I used the terms Innate (Spirit), Innate Intelligence (Spiritual Intellect), Universal Intelligence (God) because they were comprehensive, and the world was not prepared to receive the latter terms just mentioned in parentheses. It may be even now premature to use them.\"\" (page 542, The Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since vitalism is at the heart of chiropractic philosophy, and vitalism is perceived as metaphysics, the philosophy of chiropractic is not recognized by conventional medical science. Though modern medicine consider chiropractic as \"\"unscientific,\"\" it has not been able to ignore the large number of their patients that have been increasingly satisfied with chiropractic care. The success of Chiropractic in recent years has fueled the antagonism between conventional medical physicians and chiropractors. Biomedical research scientists are at a loss to explain the efficacy of chiropractic adjustment for it is in direct opposition to contemporary knowledge concerning biological \"\"control\"\" mechanisms.

Obv. mix engineers and mastering engineers play a huge part in chart success in commercial music.

The current situation has them very scared and they'll pretty much do anything do anything to fast-track their terrible plan through. This is why they're talking 1-2 week timelines whereas before they've been been screwing with the MMA community for months with an incomplete doc while AfD'ing everything in sight. Of course, short-tracking necessarily means they'll railroad the MMA voices against. If they don't get the short-track, their plan is essentially dead, which is why they'll show a tiny bit of leeway in the short term to get what they want in the long term. What's most notable is that even if they get what they want, it doesn't mean they don't AfD again right after they get approval. Their plan has no brightline rules, and it's vague and open to interpretation (which is why AfD are effective now). The situation after will be no better, but we'll be stuck with it while they're not saddled with anything.\n",

While I tried explaining that I should not be warned for something like this, they decided they did not want to hear the radical idea that they were exerting their overzealous attitude towards me, instead of being responsible admins. As a result, they decided to keep me quiet by blocking me for a week. While on this ban, they decided to accuse me of having a sockpuppet, because this user claimed he was me in an edit. Everybody knows a sockpuppet would not admit he is one in his own edit. Since they foolishly thought this user was a sockpuppet of mine, they extended the block to 1 month, to further keep me quiet. I, obviously finding this as unfair, decided to request an unblock, because an accusation that has no actual evidence is no reason to extend the block. Since this was a way of me speaking out, they rejected and even protected my page, which is why you may not be able to respond on my page until the user decides to unprotect it. \n",

To clarify what happened, he wrote an AFD nomination that misrepresented the subject as only being a minor , and specifically mentioned the role of mayor.  He made innuendo that the role of mayor was unimportant (which is technically true), but failed to mention that the gentleman was a long-time leader of the majority party on the council, and used inneundo to conflate the two unrelated.  He also apparently omitted to conduct a WP:BEFORE search for sources because when such a search is performed a plethora of sources are to be found.  When I politely pointed out this to him and gave him the opportunity to correct himself, he refused to do this, asserting things that are clearly not true to anyone with at least half a brain (that a leader of a party group is equally as important as a non-leader) and started to make personal allegations against me.  He has now compounded his lies by writing further lies at WP:AN/I which have led a productive and editor of good character being blocked.

They locked me out of their little group and wouldn't even talk to me. They teased me mercelessly and so did the popular girls group. I never got invited to any parties after 2nd grade; I never had any friends. The boys basically ignored me (until 7th grade when THEY were the ones who teased me mercelessly), while they flirted with the other girls. All the other girls would talk about was boys (when they weren't bragging to each other about thier home life). They never let me play with them, and the teacher didn't make them include me. In lunch and recess I would just sit alone or cry alone. In 6th grade one of the kids told the teacher to throw me out the window. The teacher just shook his head.

Due to the high volume of vandalism that comes from open proxies (and the very low volume of legitimate edits), it's a general presumption that anybody who (a) edits through one and (b) generally acts like a shit, is a vandal.  Ms. Kyle meets both halves of that condition.  I don't recommend that she be unblocked any time soon (I really don't see any evidence that she has ever substantially contributed to the encyclopedia, and I have no reason to believe that she would start doing so were we to unblock her), but I may have been mistaken in identifying her with the program vandals she shared an open proxy with.  She is still a very disruptive user, and her current block is totally warranted on that basis.

That's akin to placing an Algeristan in France, and making an article that treats it like a country. There are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. But I call BS on Turkey being listed under Kurdistan, as Turkey does not have a region named Kurdistan, and Kurds are Turkish citizens, not living under a Kurdish \"\"state\"\" like in Iraq, whom prints their own passports and such.  \"\n",

CDBaby lists Babyblaue Seiten as a source, and an article exists about that review site in the German Wikipedia. It looks like Breiling in Babyblaue is somewhat more reliable a source than Colli in Clouds. Although Colli's observations are interesting, I cannot see keeping them.

      "Bill Clinton's views concerning a comparison with Dred Scott are not even remotely noteworthy. Ironically, this issue was addressed in another section above, with one of the editors concluding that the fame of Clinton alone would not suffice to make the comparison noteworthy. Another editor (or perhaps it was the same) then suggested that it might be noteworthy if it involved some sort of legal analysis. The parties seemed to agree but then - inexplicably - left it in without explaining how Clinton's comparison amounts to a legal analysis. Exactly how does Clinton's statement that the case would go down in history as one of the worst SCOTUS cases along with Dred Scott amount to any sort of legal analysis? With all due respect, I would argue that this is nothing but a conclusory assertion unsupported by any sound legal reasoning and should not be included in the article. If others want to leave it in, fine, but they should realize that this will open up the flood gates for including virtually any other opinion of a famous person regardless of how unsubstantiated it may be.

      "Review of 1984 version\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a copyrighted review or summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1984, the movie The Bounty starring Anthony Hopkins as Bligh and Mel Gibson as Christian was released. The movie is set during the trial of Lt. William Bligh upon arriving home after the mutiny had occurred. In this movie, the events of the voyage up to and after the mutiny are shown as a series of flashbacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bligh is not so much portrayed as a cruel tyrant in this film, but rather as a traditional ship's captain - a man of his times. While some savage beatings were carried out under Bligh's watch in this film, it seems to be in this film no different than any other captain would have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crew is shown in a different light than in the previous two films. They are shown to be a much more \"\"rough and tumble\"\" group than the crews in the other films. Many of them are shown as typical sailors of the time. Their motivations in this film are not always as noble as in the other two films.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this film, Fletcher Christian is a more complex character. He is shown at first as a friend of Bligh. At first Bligh thinks so much of Christian that he asks the man to sail with him for a second time. However over the course of the film both men turn against each other. The feelings become much more acrimonius after the ship leaves Tahiti after Fletcher has been forced to leave his wife behind on Tahiti. In this film, she is more of a reason that Fletcher mutinied than in the previous two films. Afterwards, Fletcher is shown as feeling remorseful because of the mutiny. He tells another mutineer that he wished he had given Bligh some muskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this film, the crew is shown as having more responsibility than they did in other films. This film does not so much hold Bligh as responsible - rather it is the desire of some of the crew to go back to Tahiti. However, it does make the fact that Bligh was going to try circumnavigation as one of the reasons that some of the crew decided to mutiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the 1935 film, this version also concentrates on the trials of Bligh and those who were forced into the launch with him. It is the only film to show that one man died because of an attack by the natives of an island where the launch stopped.  Once Bligh's launch reaches a Dutch colony, his part in the story comes to an end. It shows the later voyages of the Bounty as they go to Pitcairn Island. It then goes to Bligh's trial where he is subsequently acquitted by the Admirality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1984 film was probably one of the more historically accurate of the films dealing with the Bounty. It shows both Bligh and the crew as more products of their time than anything else. This film also suggests that the motives behind the mutiny might not have been as noble as suggested in the other films. It also portrays the natives mostly nude as they would have appeared at the time of The Bounty's visit to the island (the previous films couldn't portray this because of censorship and decency concerns).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the distinguished cast—including Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson in supporting roles and Laurence Olivier in a cameo appearance as Admiral Hood—the film had a tepid critical reception (the capsule review in Newsday read in its entirety as follows: \"\"Man the bilge pumps\"\") and was not a great commercial success. \"\n",

However the units tcf, bcf, bcm return   at least 102, 147,  51 hits when used with the above phrases.

It would be original research without a source.  It's an essentially fictional book about a myth.  It sounds kinda listy.  It'll probably piss off a fair number of readers and editors.  It's only an implication, they can always pull out the God/miracle card.  But mostly it'd be unsourced.

I generally use a combination of Illustrator CS and a text editor, and any knowledge on basic SVG specifications for basic types (such as default parameter values, so that certain data can be excluded). I used to use Inkscape, but it felt too clunky and produces really bloated SVG code—it is sad to say (since I support free software) that I really appreciate Illustrator, since it is slick and produces very clean SVG code. Certainly, Adobe authored the SVG specifications, so it is not surprising that Illustrator writes the best output (in my opinion). However, when opening SVG files in Illustrator that were originally saved in the Inscape SVG format, Illustrator will usually retain the \"\"sodipodi\"\" metadata, which is specific only to that application (and Inkscape). I try to remove the sodipodi data using a text editor to keep the code to the standard SVG coding, then reopen/save in Illustrator. Another method is to save the figure as an Illustrator AI or PDF file, then reopen/save in Illustrator again to shed the sodipodi metadata. If this fails, and it is a simple circle, I redraw the object. Often I'll name objects, but remove \"\"Layer 1\"\", since multiple layers are not needed for logos. If you can, find original artwork in PDF format, and simply open it up in Illustrator, and edit then save in SVG. This way you can avoid doing too much tweaking to get around Inkscape's annoyances. +t \"\n",

      "Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland image is dubious\n",
      "\n",
      "The image depicted of the Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland is ahistorical and a creation by its author based on his interpretation of a coat of arms motif that appears on The Custom House completed in 1791 in Dublin. While a gold harp on a blue shield with a crown surmounting the shield was sometimes used by the government in Ireland, the stonework on this building that portrays the shield of Ireland in a stylistic way with the supporters for England (a lion) and Scotland (a unicorn) is simply heraldic artwork and not a proper coat of arms of the said kingdom. The Kingdom of Ireland created by Henry VIII never had its own unique royal coat of arms. i.e. a full armorial achievement. After 1603 and the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland, the royal arms of James I of England (James VI of Scotland) did include a harp for Ireland in the third quarter. the image in question is loosely based on the current UK royal arms. It was created by simply placing the shield for Ireland as the sole shield and retaining the Order of the Garter collar, St Edward's Crown, supporters and royal motto of the current UK coat of arms (which is not in this depiction in its the full armorial achievement format as it is missing the helm, crest and compartment). It is noteworthy that the creator refers to the crown as the \"\"imperial crown\"\" - which is anachronistic as there was no British Empire during the Kingdom of Ireland period. While I think the creator was sincere in thinking this was indeed the historical coat of arms for the Kingdom of Ireland from 1541 until the Act of Union 1801, Ireland - unlike Scotland - did not have its own royal coat of arms during this period. When the then Anglo-Irish parliament met for the last time before the Union of 1801, it did not request a separate royal coat of arms for use in Ireland as Scotland did almost a century before in the Act of Union 1707. If anyone has evidence to the contrary, I would be most interested to learn about it.   \"\n",

You want so much to believe that the Normans aren't related to the English that you omit them from the related groups section, but keep the Bretons who aren't even part of the British Isles.  In fact; archaeology confirms that the Bretons left Britain as Salian Franks were among the Nordic invaders when Rome fell.  TharkunColl says that the Normans aren't related, but you say that the Channel Islanders do not constitute a separate ethnic group.  Where is the consistency of logic in those assumptions, which defies consensus outside of your joint control of this article?  Things are much different in the wide world of academia and scholasticism.  Well, Channel Islanders speak a language closer to English than any Celtic tongue.  Why is that a bad thing; why does negative POV have to be accepted?  Now, who is fantasising about the Dark Ages again?  Why would the Normans of the Channel be excluded, when they are HM the Queen's loyal subjects?  Remember what they endured for us during WWII, which the Celtic nations did not have so bad...

He is upset because he views the French relationship to be unfair to England, but has no qualms about that in relation to English \"\"oppressive influence\"\" on Celtic speakers with special help by German princes.  The same POV TharkunColl uses to exclude the French is that which the Irish use to exclude the English.  The question is, why would you do something to others if you do not want it done to yourself?  (TharkunColl claims that he is not bound by the Golden Rule, since he is not Christian) The solution is for English and Irish nationalists to not act this way at the Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is not a vehicle for these types of POV; these Balkanist notions.  When discussing ethnic relatives, the Channel Islanders are a mutual bridge between the English and French.  This is confirmed by all academics and scholars; that you two fringe-theorists disagree is of no consequence to the world at large.

When George changed to Windsor, it did not conceal the true nature of the monarchyneither did the Bombing of Dresden in Saxony have that effect of integrating these Germans.  The more they try so hard to be accepted, the further our people have rejected their status as our Sovereigns.

Oh and the claim about no attribution is a blatent lie, all of the articles are given citations. If I'm wrong about the above then by all means correct me... with proof.

      "\n",
      "Generally, a certain risk of local tissue damage is involved when using local anesthetics often and regularly during a longer period at a specific location of your body. For example, the chronic use of topical eye anesthetics in chronic eye pain would almost certainly and relatively quickly lead to serious eye damage (corneal damage).\n",
      "Before using local anesthetics, chronic local pain should not only carefully be assessed with medical specialists for the local problem (for example an ophtalmologist, dermatologist, dentist or a neurologist/specialist for peripheral nerve blocks), but also by specialists for centrally active pain medication.\n",
      " Medical specialists (ophtalmologists, dermatologists, dentists or neurologists for peripheral nerve blocks) for the local problem can assess how big the risk of chronically using local anesthetics at that particular location is.\n",
      " In most cases of chronic pain, it is not the peripheral nervous system but the central nervous system that is not able to cope with the pain impulses coming from the location in the peripheral nervous system where the damage that causes the pain is actually located. Therefore, medical specialists for the central nervous system (usually a neurologist or pain specialist) can assess if and what kind of centrally acting medication can or should be taken. Very often, it is less harmful and risky to use centrally active substances (especially when they are only taken in low doses) against chronic pain in the peripheral nerve system than chronically using local anesthetics at a particular location of the body. Relatively risk free, especially when taken in small doses, and at the same time often effective against chronic peripheral pain are antidepressants of the SSRI class and the stronger tricyclic antidepressants like for example amitriptyline. Furthermore, modern anticonvulsants like pregabalin or gabapentin are relatively risk free and at the same time relatively effective against chronic pain, at least when taken in very low or low doses. One of the strongest and more risky options in the reduction of peripheral pain are anticonvulsants like carbamazepine. On the other hand, some other classes of centrally acting substances like for example opioids (they are unfortunately still often used in the treatment of chronic pain, including local pain in the peripheral nerve system) are extremely harmful and should be avoided in the treatment of chronic pain at all costs.\n",

I might as well anyways.  -   Furthermore, as far as internal textual evidence goes, there are certain things which clearly show that this could not be the work of Ptolemy.  For example, several of the aphorisms make explicit references to Horary astrology, which is not something that Ptolemy addressed at all in the Tetrabiblos.  One of the reasons for this, among others, is that interrogational astrology (ie. horary) was not developed until the 2nd and 3rd centuries and this development occurred in India within the Hindu tradition. (See Pingree, 1996, pg. 21)  Horary was not a part of the mainstream tradition of Hellenistic astrology from which Ptolemy and his contemporaries were drawing on, and it did not become integrated into the western tradition of horoscopic astrology until the Middle Ages when the various Arab and Persian astrologers undertook a synthesis of the Indian, Persian and Hellenistic traditions.  So you see, even the internal evidence in the text itself with the references to horary show that this could not have been the work of Claudius Ptolemy.\n",

      "If you read the most thorough and credible works on the subject (see below), you will see that not only did the so-called Zebra murders flow directly from NOI theology, but that they were an NOI operation, directed from Chicago (aka New Mecca), and run out of the San Francisco mosque. The San Francisco death squad had pep rallies run by dignitaries from New Mecca after hours at the NOI-owned moving and storage where most of the killers worked, and all of them worked for NOI-owned businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apprentice Death Angels had to reach a certain quota from killing either four white children, five white women, or nine white men, in order to become full-fledge Death Angels, and receive free passage to Mecca. The practice of paying free passage to Mecca for killing “white devils” had been  instituted during the early 1930s by NOI founder Wallace Fard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NOI even paid for the defense of the three killers who refused to confess (Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, and Manuel Moore), but refused to pay legal fees for the one killer, Jesse Lee Cooks, who confessed to murder (the Frances Rose killing), and went so far as to disown Cooks. The NOI considers it a mortal sin to confess to any crime in the white man's courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get an indication of how tightly the NOI operation was run, the case was only broken when one of the killers, Anthony Cornelius Harris, came forward, in order to collect the $35,000 reward, get police protection, and new identities for himself and his family. One day, when Harris & Family were in a motel under police guard, and Harris was in the shower, his foolish wife telephoned the wife of her minister, at the San Francisco mosque, and told her where they were holed up. In no time flat, a squad of NOI assassins (Fruit of Islam types, not the raggedy characters in the “Zebra” death squads) showed up at the motel, and Detectives Gus Coreris and John Fotinos just managed to escape with the Harris family seconds ahead of the assassins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the squad managed to kill Harris, the SFPD would never have broken the San Francisco cases (or at least, the 15 official San Francisco cases; there were more killings than that in the city by the bay). As it is, the convictions of Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, Manuel Moore and Jesse Lee Cooks “cleared” only 15 killings, and the SFPD was convinced that at least three other men were part of the SF squad alone. However, the San Francisco DA, convinced that it had too little evidence to go to trial against the other three, dropped the charges against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NOI is so tightly knit in its devotion to killing whites, whom it variously teaches are “white devils,” “blue-eyed devils,” and “grafted snakes,” that no one else came forward with information.\n",
      " \n",
      "Not only did the NOI organize the death squads (there were many more than the one that went down), but the killings went on up and down the State of California, with different squads working different areas, and according to the FBI, even (though apparently, or rather, hopefully, to a lesser degree) on the East Coast. Dick Walley, the head of the Intelligence Analysis Unit at the California Department of Justice, had a dossier of 71 black-on-white murders committed across the state that he was convinced were NOI killings (Howard). (Walley died of cancer before the trial.) Clark Howard, the author of Zebra, was convinced that the NOI had murdered “just under 270” whites across California, but never named the other 255 victims, or explained his rationale. Since the murders were through and through an NOI operation, and only a small minority of them (even using Walley’s figure, which did not count non-California NOI racial killings) were committed in San Francisco, I suggest that we dispense with calling them the “Zebra Murders,” and simply call them the NOI Murders.\n",

It would have been a good sermon but German pastor's English was poor. He preached on Jesus' Glorious Erection and its impact on Mary.

      "Please be more careful with your edits to pages like Born again.  It is one thing to inform someone of what a Christian concept means....it is another to preach to them.  Your edits have been increasingly aimed at preaching and are less and less simply informational.  Much of this has to do with tone: rather than announcing something as though it is true, explain who thinks it is true and why.  I hope you will not be offended by my saying this.  As a Christian here at Wikipedia, it is important to me that all those of my faith behave appropriately: I feel that (whether or not this is true) in some way the behavior of all Christians reflects on me a because of my identification with Christ.  Therefore, I would love it if you could become a positive contributor here to help display a good witness for our faith.  You will not convert people by preaching to them here: you will only enrage them and turn them more against Christianity.  In fact, you will endanger the continued existence of good informative articles about Christianity here if you persist long enough: after a while, an agnostic would likely just want to delete the articles and end the controversy.  I know what it is like to have a real and powerful faith and want to share it: please remember that the place for sharing it is not in our articles.  Leave a note on my talk page or email me if you want to discuss this.  I hope you will take a less agressive stance soon, and wish you the best regardless,  23:36, 2 Jan 2004 (UTC)\n",

Same with other methods, etc. But this whole topic (guitar pedagogy) seems to be one, where I can get information from anyone, even my neighbor. In other words: The body of knowledge related to guitar pedagogy is, to a great extent, not specialist knowledge with easy categorization of the sources of various ideas. Hence I detest when Risteski writes \"\"this work will introduce a new guitar teaching philosophy on the virtue of musical-aesthetical knowledge of classical guitar music\"\".

And the New Testament does give reasons as to why Jesus hasn't fulfilled certain prophecies, and talks about how he'll get to them later (eg, he will usher in the Messianic era of peace/God's kingdom after the apocalypse, as detailed in Revelation).\n",

At a very early age he began studying piano, and in Middle School began taking trumpet lessons at the Los Angeles Music and Arts School. There he also began taking Mariachi lessons and by age 16 was fully immersed into the Mariachi world.  Today Tizoc is privileged to have had the opportunity to play along side of some of the most talented Mariachi musicians in the world and enjoys sharing his passion for Mariachi music through teaching and performing.\n",

      "While completing his undergraduate work at Chapman University, through the support of professors and his wife, Tizoc realized a passion for writing music. Tizoc’s new found excitement for composition and new music led him to participate in Chapman’s New Music and Percussion Ensembles where he began learning percussion, and expanding his exposure to 21st century music. By his second year at Chapman, Tizoc gained admission into the composition program and began studying with composers Sean Heim and Shaun Naidoo. Compositionally, Tizoc is influenced by many different kinds of music, and aspires to use music as a medium to express some of our inner most emotions and states of mind.  His music has been performances by Chapman Universities Chamber Orchestra, New Music Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble as well as The California Ear Unit.\n",

Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a \"\"new Uncle Joe\"\" sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger.

Alexander was a popular name at this time. This of course does not mean that Jesus was given a Greek name rather than a Hebrew name, or a \"\"Hellenized\"\" Hebrew name, when he was born.

There are several issues here: first, both she and I don't think it's ethical to publish any kind of biography of a living person without notifying the person (and at least her business address is widely known). Secondly, and which has to do directly with Wikipedia, both she and I don't believe that one can, just like that, copy &paste; content that is made available for free and make profit out of it (how much of this book did the authors actually work for? we don't know, because we don't have it yet; but they take pride in \"\"basing\"\" it on wp which  is not a good sign).\n",

As for the picture of the Hinton, Wikipedia seemed to give me a hard time for trying to upload a photo unless I had explicit consent from the owner of the photo.  I had contacted Hinton previously to get some information from him personally, but I got the sense that I was annoying him slightly as he said he was really busy and was terse in his responses, so I decided not to pursue him for the picture.

      "This is already covered under the second paragraph of the Gameplay section, specifically: \"\"The campaign allows the player to assume control of a faction of the time period, and build a civilization, economy and military in order to conquer other factions. Gameplay consists of controlling the faction's military, economic, and social systems via a large campaign map. During the player's turn, armies, fleets, and agents can be moved on the map. When an army engages another army, the player can choose to fight the battle personally, in the battle mode, or automatically calculate the outcome.\"\"\n",

      "Armies are formed from 'Units' normally consisted of 20-30 men for artillery, 30-40 men for cavalry and 60-70 men for infantry or archers. In adition to this a general can also recruit mercenaries for a price if need be. An army can consist of up to twenty units, or as little as one, and will move according to the units it contains. This means that an army consisting entirely of cavalry can cover a lot of ground in one turn, but would be able to cover a much shorter distance were the army to have any artillery or infantry units. \n",

      "A general can be selected from amongst your family to lead the army, and he will benefit or hinder the army based on his personal traits, a General who starts fighting when he is young is more likely to develop a keen skill for combat that one who has spent most of his life governing a city. The risk is that should the army be beaten then the General may die, and even during a battle that is going in your favour your general can still get cut off, surrounded by the enemy or hit by a stray arrow. Losing a general can bring an end to a generation if he were the only son without an heir, which can affect your whole family tree for generations. An army without a general is lead by a captain, who will fight alongside whichever unit you select as the first unit in your army. A captain who performs well in battle may be promoted to General, and be adopted into your family. These generals are generally better suited to combat rather than Govenment roles.\n",

Each general has a number of attributes which determine how well he governs a settlement and how well he leads an army in battle. A general's actions can affect his attributes- for example, a general who routinely kills prisoners of war may see his \"\"dread\"\" increase, making him frightening to foes; a general who prefers to release prisoners may instead increase his \"\"chivalry\"\", which makes his own troops braver.\"\"\n",

Training and forming a working army is an expensive and lengthly process, and traveling to fight the enemy can take even longer, so the aim of every Battle during the campaign is to kill or capture as many of the enemy as possible, while minimizing the loss to your own army, thus allowing you to carry on fighting for longer with the same army.

      "Now - on with the explanation. The Coriolis effect is a change-of-coordinates force (and thus bears intriguing similarities with gravity, whether this means anything or not is unclear). When you move from one coordinate system to one that is rotating with respect to the first, then the equations of motion for a particle acquire an extra term: the coriolis term (and one other of second order in omega but we'll neglect that). So: if you wish to formulate the equations of motion for air on the surface of the earth, it is natural do to it in a coordinate system stationary wrt the earths surface: in that case, you end up with a coriolis force. You could, if you wished, write the equations in a system non-rotating wrt the fixed stars (perhaps ignoring the rotation of the earth round the sun). In this system, there would be no coriolis effect and hence no coriolis force. However there would be a very rapidly moving lower boundary to account for and this would be deeply inconvenient. since the coriolis term is easy to incorporate, there is no particular reason to do this. But... this is only the coordinate system in which you choose to write your equations. It has no effect on the physics, and cyclones continue to rotate no matter which system you describe them in.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "William M Connolley is simultaneously saying that the coriolis effect is physics, and that it isn't.\n",

      "An article about the coriolis effect should explain the following:.\n",
      "If (hypotherically speaking) a low pressure area would form on a non-rotating planet, then the air would flow towards the low pressure area and the pressure gradient would very rapidly be leveled.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that is not what is happening on Earth. On Earth, air starts flowing around a low pressure area, amazingly, it tends strongly to flow perpendigular to the pressure gradient, and it can take weeks for a low pressure area to become leveled again  So there must be a physical mechanism that performs a restructuring of the direction of wind flow.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A general coordinate transform transforms the entire picture in one go, if you employ a coordinate transformaton to a rotating coordinate system on, say, a large grid, then the grid will turns around as a whole, with the whole picture remaining in a fixed form.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is not what happens in the atmosphere! If you let go lots of weather balloons in the area of a low pressure area forming, then over time the positions of the balloons in the circling winds will be thoroughly mixed. The more central parts of the system rotate faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "William says that the coriolis effect is to be understood as purely a cosmetic change: a coordinate transformation, that does not alter the physics taking place. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Willam also believes the following:\n",
      "from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:William_M._Connolley/Coriolis_effect\n",
      "The Coriolis force plays a strong role in weather patterns, where it affects prevailing winds and the rotation of storms, as well as in the direction of ocean currents. Above the atmospheric boundary layer, friction plays a relatively minor role, as air parcels move mostly parallel to each other. Here, an approximate balance between pressure gradient force and Coriolis force exists, causing the geostrophic wind, which is the wind effected by these two forces only, to blow along isobars (along lines of constant geopotential height, to be precise). Thus a northern hemispheric low pressure system rotates in a counterclockwise direction, while northern hemispheric high pressure systems or cyclones on the southern hemisphere rotate in a clockwise manner, as described by Buys-Ballot's law.\n",

Der Steuersong, for example, a satirical German song about ex-Chancellor Schröder (in German, with lots of untranslatable German puns), turns up 67 hits on Factiva. Germany may be richer, but then we were at war with Serbia, so I really do believe that someone would have taken notice if the song's notability was as high as is claimed. (talk)\n",

About the author (//jainismus.hubpages.com/) this article further attest to what i was saying. And have some patience, when i have said i wil give you reference by next week, is it necessary to showcase your talents?? Also, can you show me one reference which says that they belong to any other caste??? If not then better dont get engaged in argument. \"\"Achievement of few individuals\"\"- Dear [Sitush], I am confused with this statement. Can you name one community which has that many (as per you,few) magnificent people. It is not puffery, it is just highlighting the prominent personalities of Khatri community, as done by all, Indian and Foreign tribes. So you better be cautious in using this word, \"\"puffery\"\" in this context. And let me ask you, why not a single concluded argument has been applied, you have time to reply and write all of this, but have no time to omit what has been concluded as irrelevant. And if you have 2000 articles to handle, better give responsibility to some other person who can fix it in time. [Satya301]   \n",

Guerrero), that allows an individual aircraft to be signalled so that a private message can be transmitted without other aircraft being allowed. Is this a precursor to the ACARS system? I assume it used some of the same technology as VHF mobile telephone selective call signalling systems: the aircraft's \"\"phone number\"\" was dialed on a frequency, and the aircraft compared the incoming number to the one in its own memory circuit; if it matched, it signaled with a bell or other such device, and presumably signaled the ground that it was aware of the page.\n",

The topic banned editor [User:Andreasgde] came up with a temp. solution of avoiding the usage of \"\"The/the Beatles\"\" midsentence and that apparently resolved most of the issue since 2011, until I stumbled into it and asked too many questions before somebody gave me some links and kicks. It would seem the hundreds of articles concerning The Beatles group, the Beatles members, albums, and compositions, use the syntax I just used.  [User:GabeMC] wants to  start changing all ocurrences to \"\"the Beatles\"\" mid sentence with his Straw Poll. When editors disagree he gets nasty with ridicule, argumentative and posts snipes on user talk pages. His argument is that each article can ignore WP:MOSTM on it's own consensus and only war in two or three articles, so far, on this issue. Trouble is there is no consistency in trademark usage, old documents, WP:MOS vs. WP:MOSTM, English grammar, or editor ideas that prevails with capitals or not. My concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesI have read. The issue has never been resolved due to behavioural issues induced into every discussion and a lack of Arbitated Policy continues the randon edits. Even it my mentioned method succeeds think of the rogue editor seeing this, \"\"When all the Beatles played together The Beatles made good music.\"\" I am only concerned with the unaddressed behaviour of this and a few other editors in these discussions. Nobody seems to want to take them on. Some agreed that a \"\"shot across the bow\"\" may be in order. Funny thing; all of the editors agree an arbitrated decision is needed but won't muzzle themselves long enough to draw serious attention. The mud slinging is unbeliveable and admins have told them to \"\"grow the fuck up\"\" and other less rude demands. It would seem all five or six GabeMc supporters consistently spell Andreasegde's name incorrectly despite a dozen corrections I have witnessed. That and the behaviour technique seem too coincidental, to me. Man, I hate this stuff! I just can't believe this is happening on WP with all these rules and tough nuts. ) 99.251.125.65  \"\n",

Their website is registered with the UK Government's Charity Commission as their official registered website, or are you intending to argue that the Charities Commission of the United Kingdom also fails to meet credibility policy?  (it would not surprise me if you did, even though that organization also has it's own Wiki entry and is referenced thousands of times in other articles - editors like you and TheOldjacobite like to pick and choose which reference points based on personal opinion, and not the fact of the matter.  That is shown in your logs. Having looked at WP:SONGCOVER for the twentieth time, this entry clearly meets all the criteria, so please stop quoting policy enforcement when the policy is met, otherwise you risk making yourself look more and more stupid every time you delete it or incorrectly quote a policy to which the entry conforms.\n",

He also asked for the page to be locked, and me blocked, on the basis of the entry - see the referrals for vandalism and page locking request pages...etc.  The entry was reviewed and found to be suitable and referenced correctly, even if the BBC programme has since been archived - that is, however, the whole point of the archival retrieval date noted within the reference tag.\n",

Even before I was blocked from Wikipedia, I did add in more reference, I read some of the notability guild lines and did make some changes, however I am only one person and there is so much I could do before I can say, 'I done my fair share, can someone help me finish this?'. But clearly not. I really don't know Wikipedia as well as you and other administrators do, but considering I have made many pages and edited many more in the short time I have started using Wikipedia properly, I can say that I have made useful information for people to read about and get accurate accounts of this. My point with this is that even though I have made massive contributions on here, there are things I do not know, and how to get pages back on Wikipedia after they are deleted is one of them.

Perhaps the problem can be best summarized by your own comment on this page when you said that you thought about the issue and came to agree with the rest of the group. In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance, your actions were shameful. When faced with a group of people who reached consensus, you still had the audacity to have the page locked to reflect your (poorly reasoned) point of view. These are the actions of a stubborn child who wants his way and completely contradictory to what Wikipedia is about. I think you should grow up, recognize that your positions are often incorrect, and defer to the democratic process.

By far the main number of references on news.google for 'Macedonia country' reveals \"\"Macedonia\"\" as the common term, but we knew that is the common English usage. How Macedonia can be ambiguous in a list of nations is beyond me, apart from the fact that Macedonia happens to be a disamb. page. But being a disambig. page on WP does not imply disambiguity in the real world, or for that sake in this list. The reason the WP article is at \"\"Rep. of\"\" is only to disambiguate. Likewise Denmark can refer to loads of different stuff, so why not link to \"\"Kingdom of Denmark\"\". The difference? The ad hoc nature of wikipedia. So the question is whether to replicate the ad hoc basis in the list.   \"\n",

Spaniards with smallpox can have arrived in other part of the Yucatan and infect the people there, and later these people could extend the sickness to other regions through trade or war. The Southern Ming never visited Europe, but their Black Plague destroyed 1/3 of the European population, and the Incas fell on civil war because an epidemy of smallpox in Mexico extended to South America and killed the emperor and his heir.

I have been with people of many religions and found their intellectuals are always secular in research e.g. Jehovah's witness are very very fundamentalist Christians.  However their research about Islam is very secular as printed in their paper.  Their conclusion is not secular ofcourse.  Then you can read \"\"Christian Science Monitor\"\" which is also a very fundamentalist organization's paper.  You can not point a finger on their secular research.  Again, their POV appears seperately.  I am a staunch fundamentalist Muslim (fundamentalist meaning sticking to fundamentals as foundation and building over it, not sticking to fundamentals and destroy all construction over it).  However I am certified in studies of Old Testament and the new Testaments and have done a lot of faith sharing to form my own knowledge about Jews and Christians, not what the Mullah told me when I was a kid. \"\n",

The only magazine article I can think of is that (in)famous Nick Kent \"\"The Face\"\" 1985 article on The Smiths. There are also a few pages about her in \"\"The Severed Alliance\"\", but it's similar stuff as in that Ludus biography you posted the link to, plus some interesting quotes by Richard Boon and Trotter. Apparently her flat in Whalley Range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. They also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle, that Pete Shelley wrote Buzzcocks' 'What Do I Get' as a plea of unrequited love for her, and that she inspired a lot of Devoto's early work. Her name also pops up a lot in \"\"Songs That Saved Your Life\"\" - besides Cemetry Gates, she's mentioned in entries for Miserable Lie, Wonderful Woman, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me (in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single) and I Won't Share You. In the latter, there's another quote from the unused Morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled Crepuscule Ludus restrospective - the end of the note sounds very familiar: \"\"Oh Linder. Oh Linder.

      "\n",
      "But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.\n",

      "You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.\n",

      "The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.\n",

In regards to F.'s status as a reliable source however, there should be no argument about that. F. most certainly qualifies. He is one of the most high-profile scholars on the Arab-Israeli question, he has received plaudits from other greatly respected experts in the field (see Schlaim's endorsement above, or that of Raul Hilberg who supported his work and said he would be \"\"vindicated\"\" by history), and he has written best selling books on the conflict that have been  praised both inside and outside academia and translated into multiple languages. His book A Nation on Trial was named a notable book for 1998 by the New York Times. His latest book \"\"Beyond Chutzpah\"\" was published by the University of California Press after perhaps the most thorough peer review of any book on the conflict ever.

F. was denied tenure only because someone didn't like his attitude. But there is nothing in Wiki policies that disqualify sources on the basis of some alleged flaws of personality.

      "Long wave, because of the long wavelength, needs impractically large antennas to broadcast with any reasonable efficiency. The tallest ever man-made structure before the Burj Khalifa was a longwave transmitter: Warsaw radio mast. Its ground wave range is also relatively long compared to medium wave, which means that the transmissions will reach out over a much wider area (1000 km is not unusual). That may sound like an advantage, but at such low frequencies, bandwidth is at a premium, so the longwave band has to be rather small (it's just over 100 kHz wide in Europe). Combine those two effects, and and what happens is that a single medium-powered transmitter will swamp a very large area, making that frequency unusable to anyone else, and taking away almost 10% of the available frequency space within that wide area. So the longwave band is good purely from a transmission effectiveness point of view (if you ignore lightning interference) but it doesn't work too well on a economical/commercial level. This is one of the reasons the FM band was moved from 50 MHz to its modern place after WW2: the higher frequencies are much more strongly localised to one area, so there is room for a lot more stations in a given space and stations can cater more easily to smaller, local audiences, which keeps costs down and attracts more people. A longwave transmitter for a single large city is silly, but for VHF it works.\n",

      "@AynHaylo The Aramean movement is based on our real heritage and history, which forms this strong foundation! Your invented \"\"Assyrian\"\" ethnic identity has no foundation among the Syriac Christians (Suryoye) before the 19th century. Once again, the Syriac-Orthodox Church has clearly its roots in the Aramean nation and can prove an Aramean ethnic identity by its chronicles, which goes hundreds of years back even before the 20th century, whereas the \"\"Assyrian\"\" Church of the East can't prove its Assyrian identity before the 19th century. BTW we are actually known as Süryaniler in Turkish and as Syrianin in Arabic, both words mean Syrians, but refer to the Aramaic-speaking Christians. In Arabic you have two words for Syrian, but with different meanings. Moreover, the bible clearly distinguish between Syrians (Arameans) and Assyrians. Syrian is the Greek word for Aramean and this word was adopted by the Arameans in their mother tongue and they have called themselves Suryoye since then. I don't care about what other people call us. Most Germans call oriental-looking persons Turks and every black person is just an African. What matters is what we call ourselves. We have always called ourselves Suryoye (Syrians) and our origin is Aramaic, not pseudo Assyrian. \n",

Some, like outspoken atheists, will have more than many from conservative religious parts of society who disagree. That's a given. We cannot possibly list all the criticism, so what's the point of listing any? We should just describe what's significant about someone (i.e. why they have an article here) and let others decide on the merits of their actions and views. The same goes for people significant for their strong religious views. List those views, and let it stand.

We can report what reliable sources say about it, but cannot take a position on the matter. Also, if we imply that butter needs replacing because of alleged problems, we really need to apply equivalent standards to the alternatives. Potential problems have been found with at least some of the alternatives. To just list alternatives, thereby implying that butter is problematic, without mentioning issues with the alternatives, is unacceptable.

      "The distinction I would draw is whether the content is published and accepted.  Wikipedia:No original research#What_is_excluded.3F gives a list of seven criteria for determining whether or not something is original research ... but really what it boils down to is whether or not you can find other secondary sources making the same claim.  I had never heard of this tomb before this evening so obviously I don't know enough about it to say what is and is not accepted science in this respect.  ;)  From what you are saying, it sounds like there are two questions - (1) is it appropriate to discuss the symbolism findings in the article and (2) if so, is it appropriate to cite your work.  In the case of the former, it depends on whether or not this has become an accepted finding.  Is it still a theory or has it gained acceptance?  Have other authors picked up on it and do they cite it as accepted truth or as a new theory?  The primary reason for the original research policy is that there are constantly new theories coming out about everything - Jimbo (the founder of Wikipedia) originally mentioned physics, but I think it applies to any field.  Some theories are good for a term paper or thesis and never see the light of day again.  Others become accepted truth over time.  Wikipedia is not the place for giving a sounding board to new ideas and theories - we wait until they are accepted.  The second question is whether, if this content is to be included, it would be appropriate to cite your book.  I believe, as I said before, that you (personally) should not add it, but should let someone else do it - that's just basic journalistic integrity - we as individual editors don't promote our own stuff.  Blogs are almost never considered appropriate ... so I really don't think having a link to your blog would be a good idea.  Sources on Wikipedia should be peer-reviewed journals, newspapers, etc, where more than one person is responsible for the content.  Blogs are generally a bad thing.  I hope all this helps ... I know I've rambled a bit.

On the 1872 map, only the upper rim of the South (or lower rim of the Midwest, depending at how one looks at it) received higher influxes of German, and this it is shaded darker than portions further south.  The Germans are relevant here because they tended to despise slavery, given how they viewed it in relation to the serf system of their homeland.  The border states generally attracted fewer Germans because of the legality of slavery; when they did settle in these states, the Germans by and large chose cities like St. Louis, Louisville, Covington, etc. for economic opportunities and because of a general identification with the culture.\n",

They are completely unnotable and I am yet to encounter anyone who actually belongs to this anti-cult group? Chances are they are also a cult group, or even a ghost religion (one that exists only in the Internet). I don't think that articles from the Bereans website qualify as reliable third-party published source as per WP:RS. If you remove all the Bereans references in the Ang Dating Daan article and replace them all with citation needed tags, we can probably remove all of those unsourced statements within a month's time. It is unfair to use critical quotes from websites of other religious organizations because of the obvious bias. Quotes should be either from notable newspapers, magazines and books (self-published books not included). As I will never use articles from Soriano's website(s) to criticize, say for example, the Baptist sect, I would also not use articles from a Baptist website to criticize Soriano's sect. The rules must be applied to all for the interest of fairness and equality. –\n",

As the FLDS leadership continued to prophesy that the end of the world was quickly approaching, they taught the people that wickedness needed to be purged from their society. Jeffs taught, 'One or two covenant breakers can cause the Lord to stop blessing this people. As long as we have evil doers among us, the Lord's blessings will be withheld. Zion must be pure. We can't have evil people among the priesthood for the Lord to appear and bless us like He would like to. Be this a warning.' (W.S.J. 12/26/95) Jeffs laid the doctrinal groundwork to justify a cleansing of the FLDS. Their theology teaches that an ancient city lead by a prophet named Enoch, was taken up into heaven because of their righteousness. The FLDS believe they can be taken up too as the wicked world is destroyed.\"\"[... ... \"\"Yearning for Zion,\"\" a hymn by W.S. Jeffs; 3rd verse]:Imagine the people of Enoch of old, trained in the order of heaven/ A beautiful city the Lord called his own and forever made his abode/ Coming to join with the Zion on earth when finally the earth finds its rest/ A kingdom established in celestial laws, a people the Lord can accept/ A New Jerusalem it will be, a land of refuge, a city of peace [ . . . ]\"\n",

My concern is sourcing, in particular sourcing beyond what got the ~'List of people who signed a letter or attended an event' in the article at first and your statement made me fear that was where you were going. I was also concerned about using people who had only signed one letter. Your Energy and Empire draws a direct link between those signers and positions in the Administration so my concern arising from that Iraq letter is greatly diminished. As to the forced title I have no objection to something like 'Members of PNAC involved in the Bush Administration'. My concern is that the in the current environment we would likely end up in a month long debate about who were 'Members of PNAC' and what constituted the 'Administration'.

      "\n",
      "Hypertension\n",
      " \n",
      "Hypertension is a disorder characterized by consistently high blood pressure. Generally, high blood pressure consists of systolic blood pressure (the \"\"top\"\" number, which represents the pressure generated when the heart beats) higher than 140, or diastolic blood pressure (the \"\"bottom\"\" number, which represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart is at rest) over 90.\n",
      "\n",
      "Effect on the Eyes\n",
      "High blood pressure can injure the eyes, causing a condition called retinopathy\n",
      "Hypertensive retinopathy\n",
      " \n",
      "Damage to the retina from high blood pressure is called hypertensive retinopathy. It occurs as the existing high blood pressure changes the microvasculature of the retina. Some of the first findings in the disease are flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. As hypertensive retinopathy progresses, hard exudates can appear around the macula along with swelling of the macula and the optic nerve, causing impairment of vision. In severe cases permanent damage to the optic nerve or macula can occur.\n",
      "Bone Loss\n",
      "Hypertension also increases the elimination of calcium in urine, potentially leading to loss of bone mineral density, a significant risk factor for fractures, particularly in elderly women. In one study, women with the highest levels of blood pressure lost bone density at nearly twice the rate of those in the lowest range. It is not clear whether this effect occurs in men or in non-Caucasian women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexual Dysfunction\n",
      "Sexual dysfunction is more common and more severe in men with hypertension and in smokers than it is in the general population. Many of the drugs that treat hypertension are thought to cause impotence as a side effect. In these cases, it is reversible when the drugs are stopped. More recent evidence suggests, however, that the disease process that causes hypertension is itself the major cause of erectile dysfunction in these men. Newer anti-hypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), are less associated with erectile dysfunction. ARBs, such as losartan (Cozaar), may be particularly effective in restoring erectile function in men with high blood pressure. Sildenafil (Viagra) is successful in achieving erections in almost two-thirds of patients with controlled high blood pressure. Because sildenafil has a shorter half-life and is eliminated more quickly from the body than newer erectile dysfunction drugs, it may be a safer option for men with hypertension. In a 2003 review of safety data, sildenafil did not appear to pose a risk for men who had both high blood pressure and erectile dysfunction.\n",
      "Pregnancy and Preeclampsia\n",
      "Severe, sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women is one component of a condition called preeclampsia (commonly called toxemia) that can be very serious for both mother and child. Preeclampsia occurs in up to 10% of all pregnancies, usually in the third trimester of a first pregnancy, and resolves immediately after delivery. Other symptoms and signs of preeclampsia include protein in the urine, severe headaches, and swollen ankles.\n",
      "This condition may be caused by a failure of the placenta to embed properly in the uterus, which causes it to misconnect with the mother's blood vessels. As a result, the fetus does not receive a sufficient blood supply, and the mother's own blood pressure increases to replace it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reduced supply of blood to the placenta can cause low birth weight and eye or brain damage in the fetus. Severe cases of preeclampsia can cause kidney damage, convulsion, and coma in the mother and can be lethal to both mother and child.\n",
      "Women at risk for preeclampsia (particularly those with existing hypertension) may benefit from having an ultrasound of uterine arteries at 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, followed (if abnormal) by 24-hour blood pressure monitoring.\n",
      "Uterine Fibroids\n",
      "High blood pressure may increase the risk of developing fibroids, according to data from the Nurses’ Health Study. Tracking women for 10 years, the prospective epidemiologic study found that for every 10 mm/Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure, the risk for developing fibroids increased by 8 - 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outlook for Children with Hypertension\n",
      "Children with high blood pressure should first be treated with lifestyle changes, including weight reduction, increased physical activity, and diet modification. If blood pressure is not controlled with lifestyle changes, drug treatment may be required. Although there are few clinical trials conducted in children, a 2005 study found that the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was safe and effective in children. Results of studies evaluating outcomes of children with hypertension suggest that early abnormalities, including enlarged heart and abnor\n",
